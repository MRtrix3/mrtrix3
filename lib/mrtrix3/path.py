# Get the full absolute path to a user-specified location.
#   This function serves two purposes:
#   To get the intended user-specified path when a script is operating inside a temporary directory, rather than
#     the directory that was current when the user specified the path;
#   To add quotation marks where the output path is being interpreted as part of a full command string
#     (e.g. to be passed to run.command()); without these quotation marks, paths that include spaces would be
#     erroneously split, subsequently confusing whatever command is being invoked.
