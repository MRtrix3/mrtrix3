# Get the full absolute path to a user-specified location.
# This function serves two purposes:
# - To get the intended user-specified path when a script is operating inside a scratch directory, rather than
#     the directory that was current when the user specified the path;
# - To add quotation marks where the output path is being interpreted as part of a full command string
#     (e.g. to be passed to run.command()); without these quotation marks, paths that include spaces would be
#     erroneously split, subsequently confusing whatever command is being invoked.
#   If the filesystem path provided by the script is to be interpreted in isolation, rather than as one part
#     of a command string, then parameter 'escape' should be set to False in order to not add quotation marks

# Wait until a particular file not only exists, but also does not have any
#   other process operating on it (so hopefully whatever created it has
#   finished its work)
# This functionality is achieved in different ways, depending on the capabilities
#   of the system:
#   - On Windows, two processes cannot open the same file in read mode. Therefore,
#     try to open the file in 'rb+' mode, which requests write access but does not
#     create a new file if none exists
#   - If command fuser is available, use it to test if any processes are currently
#     accessing the file (note that since fuser's silent mode is used and a decision
#     is made based on the return code, other processes accessing the file will
#     result in the script pausing regardless of whether or not those processes have
#     write mode access)
#   - If neither of those applies, no additional safety check can be performed.
# Initially, checks for the file once every 1/1000th of a second; this gradually
#   increases if the file still doesn't exist, until the program is only checking
#   for the file once a minute.
