Convert a connectome node image from one lookup table to another
Typical usage is to convert a parcellation image provided by some other software, based on the lookup table provided by that software, to conform to a new lookup table, particularly one where the node indices increment from 1, in preparation for connectome construction; examples of such target lookup table files are provided in share//mrtrix3//labelconvert//, but can be created by the user to provide the desired node set // ordering // colours.
A more thorough description of the operation and purpose of the labelconvert command can be found in the online documentation:

Convert a Desikan-Killiany parcellation image as provided by FreeSurfer to have nodes incrementing from 1: $ labelconvert aparc+aseg.mgz FreeSurferColorLUT.txt mrtrix3//share//mrtrix3//labelconvert//fs_default.txt nodes.mif  Paths to the files in the example above would need to be revised according to their locations on the user's system.
ARGUMENT path_in 0 0 IMAGEIN
the input image
ARGUMENT lut_in 0 0 FILEIN
the connectome lookup table corresponding to the input image
ARGUMENT lut_out 0 0 FILEIN
the target connectome lookup table for the output image
ARGUMENT image_out 0 0 IMAGEOUT
the output image
OPTION spine 1 0
provide a manually-defined segmentation of the base of the spine where the streamlines terminate, so that this can become a node in the connection matrix.
ARGUMENT image 0 0 IMAGEIN
OPTION info 1 0
display information messages.
OPTION quiet 1 0
do not display information messages or progress status; alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.
OPTION debug 1 0
display debugging messages.
OPTION force 1 0
force overwrite of output files (caution: using the same file as input and output might cause unexpected behaviour).
OPTION nthreads 1 0
use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).
ARGUMENT number 0 0 INT 0 9223372036854775807
OPTION config 1 1
temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.
ARGUMENT key 0 0 TEXT
ARGUMENT value 0 0 TEXT
OPTION help 1 0
display this information page and exit.
OPTION version 1 0
display version information and exit.
