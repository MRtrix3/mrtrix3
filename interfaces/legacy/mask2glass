Create a glass brain from mask input
The output of this command is a glass brain image, which can be viewed using the volume render option in mrview, and used for visualisation purposes to view results in 3D.
While the name of this script indicates that a binary mask image is required as input, it can also operate on a floating-point image. One way in which this can be exploited is to compute the mean of all subject masks within template space, in which case this script will produce a smoother result than if a binary template mask were to be used as input.
ARGUMENT input 0 0 IMAGEIN
The input mask image
ARGUMENT output 0 0 IMAGEOUT
The output glass brain image
