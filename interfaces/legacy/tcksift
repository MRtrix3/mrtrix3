Filter a whole-brain fibre-tracking data set such that the streamline densities match the FOD lobe integrals
ARGUMENT in_tracks 0 0 TRACKSIN
the input track file
ARGUMENT in_fod 0 0 IMAGEIN
input image containing the spherical harmonics of the fibre orientation distributions
ARGUMENT out_tracks 0 0 TRACKSOUT
the output filtered tracks file
OPTION nofilter 1 0
do NOT perform track filtering - just construct the model in order to provide output debugging images
OPTION output_at_counts 1 0
output filtered track files (and optionally debugging images if -output_debug is specified) at specific numbers of remaining streamlines; provide as comma-separated list of integers
ARGUMENT counts 0 0 ISEQ
OPTION proc_mask 1 0
provide an image containing the processing mask weights for the model; image spatial dimensions must match the fixel image
ARGUMENT image 0 0 IMAGEIN
OPTION act 1 0
use an ACT five-tissue-type segmented anatomical image to derive the processing mask
ARGUMENT image 0 0 IMAGEIN
OPTION fd_scale_gm 1 0
provide this option (in conjunction with -act) to heuristically downsize the fibre density estimates based on the presence of GM in the voxel. This can assist in reducing tissue interface effects when using a single-tissue deconvolution algorithm
OPTION no_dilate_lut 1 0
do NOT dilate FOD lobe lookup tables; only map streamlines to FOD lobes if the precise tangent lies within the angular spread of that lobe
OPTION make_null_lobes 1 0
add an additional FOD lobe to each voxel, with zero integral, that covers all directions with zero / negative FOD amplitudes
OPTION remove_untracked 1 0
remove FOD lobes that do not have any streamline density attributed to them; this improves filtering slightly, at the expense of longer computation time (and you can no longer do quantitative comparisons between reconstructions if this is enabled)
OPTION fd_thresh 1 0
fibre density threshold; exclude an FOD lobe from filtering processing if its integral is less than this amount (streamlines will still be mapped to it, but it will not contribute to the cost function or the filtering)
ARGUMENT value 0 0 FLOAT 0 6.28319
OPTION csv 1 0
output statistics of execution per iteration to a .csv file
ARGUMENT file 0 0 FILEOUT
OPTION out_mu 1 0
output the final value of SIFT proportionality coefficient mu to a text file
ARGUMENT file 0 0 FILEOUT
OPTION output_debug 1 0
write to a directory various output images for assessing & debugging performance etc.
ARGUMENT dirpath 0 0 DIROUT
OPTION out_selection 1 0
output a text file containing the binary selection of streamlines
ARGUMENT path 0 0 FILEOUT
OPTION term_number 1 0
number of streamlines - continue filtering until this number of streamlines remain
ARGUMENT value 0 0 INT 1 9223372036854775807
OPTION term_ratio 1 0
termination ratio - defined as the ratio between reduction in cost function, and reduction in density of streamlines.
Smaller values result in more streamlines being filtered out.
ARGUMENT value 0 0 FLOAT 1e-06 inf
OPTION term_mu 1 0
terminate filtering once the SIFT proportionality coefficient reaches a given value
ARGUMENT value 0 0 FLOAT 0 inf
OPTION info 1 0
display information messages.
OPTION quiet 1 0
do not display information messages or progress status; alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.
OPTION debug 1 0
display debugging messages.
OPTION force 1 0
force overwrite of output files (caution: using the same file as input and output might cause unexpected behaviour).
OPTION nthreads 1 0
use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).
ARGUMENT number 0 0 INT 0 9223372036854775807
OPTION config 1 1
temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.
ARGUMENT key 0 0 TEXT
ARGUMENT value 0 0 TEXT
OPTION help 1 0
display this information page and exit.
OPTION version 1 0
display version information and exit.
