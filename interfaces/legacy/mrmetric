Computes a dissimilarity metric between two images
Currently only the mean squared difference is fully implemented.
ARGUMENT image1 0 0 IMAGEIN
the first input image.
ARGUMENT image2 0 0 IMAGEIN
the second input image.
OPTION space 1 0
voxel (default): per voxel image1: scanner space of image 1 image2: scanner space of image 2 average: scanner space of the average affine transformation of image 1 and 2 
ARGUMENT iteration method 0 0 CHOICE voxel image1 image2 average
OPTION interp 1 0
set the interpolation method to use when reslicing (choices: nearest, linear, cubic, sinc. Default: linear).
ARGUMENT method 0 0 CHOICE nearest linear cubic sinc
OPTION metric 1 0
define the dissimilarity metric used to calculate the cost. Choices: diff (squared differences), cc (non-normalised negative cross correlation aka negative cross covariance). Default: diff). cc is only implemented for -space average and -interp linear and cubic.
ARGUMENT method 0 0 CHOICE diff cc
OPTION mask1 1 0
mask for image 1
ARGUMENT image 0 0 IMAGEIN
OPTION mask2 1 0
mask for image 2
ARGUMENT image 0 0 IMAGEIN
OPTION nonormalisation 1 0
do not normalise the dissimilarity metric to the number of voxels.
OPTION overlap 1 0
output number of voxels that were used.
OPTION info 1 0
display information messages.
OPTION quiet 1 0
do not display information messages or progress status; alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.
OPTION debug 1 0
display debugging messages.
OPTION force 1 0
force overwrite of output files (caution: using the same file as input and output might cause unexpected behaviour).
OPTION nthreads 1 0
use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).
ARGUMENT number 0 0 INT 0 9223372036854775807
OPTION config 1 1
temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.
ARGUMENT key 0 0 TEXT
ARGUMENT value 0 0 TEXT
OPTION help 1 0
display this information page and exit.
OPTION version 1 0
display version information and exit.
