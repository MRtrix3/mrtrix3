Generate a fixel-fixel connectivity matrix
This command will generate a directory containing three images, which encodes the fixel-fixel connectivity matrix. Documentation regarding this format and how to use it will come in the future.
Fixel data are stored utilising the fixel directory format described in the main documentation, which can be found at the following link: 
https://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/3.0.4/fixel_based_analysis/fixel_directory_format.html
ARGUMENT fixel_directory 0 0 DIRIN
the directory containing the fixels between which connectivity will be quantified
ARGUMENT tracks 0 0 TRACKSIN
the tracks used to determine fixel-fixel connectivity
ARGUMENT matrix 0 0 DIROUT
the output fixel-fixel connectivity matrix directory path
OPTION threshold 1 0
a threshold to define the required fraction of shared connections to be included in the neighbourhood (default: 0.01)
ARGUMENT value 0 0 FLOAT 0 1
OPTION angle 1 0
the max angle threshold for assigning streamline tangents to fixels (Default: 45 degrees)
ARGUMENT value 0 0 FLOAT 0 90
OPTION mask 1 0
provide a fixel data file containing a mask of those fixels to be computed; fixels outside the mask will be empty in the output matrix
ARGUMENT file 0 0 IMAGEIN
OPTION tck_weights_in 1 0
specify a text scalar file containing the streamline weights
ARGUMENT path 0 0 FILEIN
OPTION count 1 0
export a fixel data file encoding the number of connections for each fixel
ARGUMENT path 0 0 IMAGEOUT
OPTION extent 1 0
export a fixel data file encoding the extent of connectivity (sum of weights) for each fixel
ARGUMENT path 0 0 IMAGEOUT
OPTION info 1 0
display information messages.
OPTION quiet 1 0
do not display information messages or progress status; alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.
OPTION debug 1 0
display debugging messages.
OPTION force 1 0
force overwrite of output files (caution: using the same file as input and output might cause unexpected behaviour).
OPTION nthreads 1 0
use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).
ARGUMENT number 0 0 INT 0 9223372036854775807
OPTION config 1 1
temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.
ARGUMENT key 0 0 TEXT
ARGUMENT value 0 0 TEXT
OPTION help 1 0
display this information page and exit.
OPTION version 1 0
display version information and exit.
