Voxel-based analysis using permutation testing and threshold-free cluster enhancement
In some software packages, a column of ones is automatically added to the GLM design matrix; the purpose of this column is to estimate the "global intercept", which is the predicted value of the observed variable if all explanatory variables were to be zero. However there are rare situations where including such a column would not be appropriate for a particular experimental design. Hence, in MRtrix3 statistical inference commands, it is up to the user to determine whether or not this column of ones should be included in their design matrix, and add it explicitly if necessary. The contrast matrix must also reflect the presence of this additional column.
ARGUMENT input 0 0 FILEIN
a text file containing the file names of the input images, one file per line
ARGUMENT design 0 0 FILEIN
the design matrix
ARGUMENT contrast 0 0 FILEIN
the contrast matrix
ARGUMENT mask 0 0 IMAGEIN
a mask used to define voxels included in the analysis.
ARGUMENT output 0 0 TEXT
the filename prefix for all output.
OPTION notest 1 0
don't perform statistical inference; only output population statistics (effect size, stdev etc)
OPTION errors 1 0
specify nature of errors for shuffling; options are: ee,ise,both (default: ee)
ARGUMENT spec 0 0 CHOICE ee ise both
OPTION exchange_within 1 0
specify blocks of observations within each of which data may undergo restricted exchange
ARGUMENT file 0 0 FILEIN
OPTION exchange_whole 1 0
specify blocks of observations that may be exchanged with one another (for independent and symmetric errors, sign-flipping will occur block-wise)
ARGUMENT file 0 0 FILEIN
OPTION strong 1 0
use strong familywise error control across multiple hypotheses
OPTION nshuffles 1 0
the number of shuffles (default: 5000)
ARGUMENT number 0 0 INT 1 9223372036854775807
OPTION permutations 1 0
manually define the permutations (relabelling). The input should be a text file defining a m x n matrix, where each relabelling is defined as a column vector of size m, and the number of columns, n, defines the number of permutations. Can be generated with the palm_quickperms function in PALM (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/PALM). Overrides the -nshuffles option.
ARGUMENT file 0 0 FILEIN
OPTION nonstationarity 1 0
perform non-stationarity correction
OPTION skew_nonstationarity 1 0
specify the skew parameter for empirical statistic calculation (default for this command is 1)
ARGUMENT value 0 0 FLOAT 0 inf
OPTION nshuffles_nonstationarity 1 0
the number of shuffles to use when precomputing the empirical statistic image for non-stationarity correction (default: 5000)
ARGUMENT number 0 0 INT 1 9223372036854775807
OPTION permutations_nonstationarity 1 0
manually define the permutations (relabelling) for computing the emprical statistics for non-stationarity correction. The input should be a text file defining a m x n matrix, where each relabelling is defined as a column vector of size m, and the number of columns, n, defines the number of permutations. Can be generated with the palm_quickperms function in PALM (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/PALM) Overrides the -nshuffles_nonstationarity option.
ARGUMENT file 0 0 FILEIN
OPTION tfce_dh 1 0
the height increment used in the tfce integration (default: 0.1)
ARGUMENT value 0 0 FLOAT 1e-06 inf
OPTION tfce_e 1 0
tfce extent exponent (default: 0.5)
ARGUMENT value 0 0 FLOAT 0 inf
OPTION tfce_h 1 0
tfce height exponent (default: 2)
ARGUMENT value 0 0 FLOAT 0 inf
OPTION variance 1 0
define variance groups for the G-statistic; measurements for which the expected variance is equivalent should contain the same index
ARGUMENT file 0 0 FILEIN
OPTION ftests 1 0
perform F-tests; input text file should contain, for each F-test, a row containing ones and zeros, where ones indicate the rows of the contrast matrix to be included in the F-test.
ARGUMENT path 0 0 FILEIN
OPTION fonly 1 0
only assess F-tests; do not perform statistical inference on entries in the contrast matrix
OPTION column 1 1
add a column to the design matrix corresponding to subject voxel-wise values (note that the contrast matrix must include an additional column for each use of this option); the text file provided via this option should contain a file name for each subject
ARGUMENT path 0 0 FILEIN
OPTION threshold 1 0
the cluster-forming threshold to use for a standard cluster-based analysis. This disables TFCE, which is the default otherwise.
ARGUMENT value 0 0 FLOAT 1e-06 inf
OPTION connectivity 1 0
use 26-voxel-neighbourhood connectivity (Default: 6)
OPTION info 1 0
display information messages.
OPTION quiet 1 0
do not display information messages or progress status; alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.
OPTION debug 1 0
display debugging messages.
OPTION force 1 0
force overwrite of output files (caution: using the same file as input and output might cause unexpected behaviour).
OPTION nthreads 1 0
use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).
ARGUMENT number 0 0 INT 0 9223372036854775807
OPTION config 1 1
temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.
ARGUMENT key 0 0 TEXT
ARGUMENT value 0 0 TEXT
OPTION help 1 0
display this information page and exit.
OPTION version 1 0
display version information and exit.
