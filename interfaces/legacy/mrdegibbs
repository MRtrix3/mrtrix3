Remove Gibbs Ringing Artifacts
This application attempts to remove Gibbs ringing artefacts from MRI images using the method of local subvoxel-shifts proposed by Kellner et al. (see reference below for details). By default, the original 2D slice-wise version is used. If the -mode 3d option is provided, the program will run the 3D version as proposed by Bautista et al. (also in the reference list below).
This command is designed to run on data directly after it has been reconstructed by the scanner, before any interpolation of any kind has taken place. You should not run this command after any form of motion correction (e.g. not after dwifslpreproc). Similarly, if you intend running dwidenoise, you should run denoising before this command to not alter the noise structure, which would impact on dwidenoise's performance.
Note that this method is designed to work on images acquired with full k-space coverage. Running this method on partial Fourier ('half-scan') or filtered data may not remove all ringing artefacts. Users are encouraged to acquired full-Fourier data where possible, and disable any form of filtering on the scanner.
ARGUMENT in 0 0 IMAGEIN
the input image.
ARGUMENT out 0 0 IMAGEOUT
the output image.
OPTION mode 1 0
specify the mode of operation. Valid choices are: 2d, 3d (default: 2d). The 2d mode corresponds to the original slice-wise approach as propoosed by Kellner et al., appropriate for images acquired using 2D muli-slice approaches. The 3d mode corresponds to the 3D volume-wise extension proposed by Bautista et al., which is appropriate for images acquired using 3D Fourier encoding.
ARGUMENT type 0 0 CHOICE 2d 3d
OPTION axes 1 0
select the slice axes (default: 0,1 - i.e. x-y). Select all 3 spatial axes for 3D operation, i.e. 0:2 or 0,1,2 (this is equivalent to '-mode 3d').
ARGUMENT list 0 0 ISEQ
OPTION nshifts 1 0
discretization of subpixel spacing (default: 20).
ARGUMENT value 0 0 INT 8 128
OPTION minW 1 0
left border of window used for TV computation (default: 1).
ARGUMENT value 0 0 INT 0 10
OPTION maxW 1 0
right border of window used for TV computation (default: 3).
ARGUMENT value 0 0 INT 0 128
OPTION datatype 1 0
specify output image data type. Valid choices are: float16, float16le, float16be, float32, float32le, float32be, float64, float64le, float64be, int64, uint64, int64le, uint64le, int64be, uint64be, int32, uint32, int32le, uint32le, int32be, uint32be, int16, uint16, int16le, uint16le, int16be, uint16be, cfloat16, cfloat16le, cfloat16be, cfloat32, cfloat32le, cfloat32be, cfloat64, cfloat64le, cfloat64be, int8, uint8, bit.

OPTION info 1 0
display information messages.
OPTION quiet 1 0
do not display information messages or progress status; alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.
OPTION debug 1 0
display debugging messages.
OPTION force 1 0
force overwrite of output files (caution: using the same file as input and output might cause unexpected behaviour).
OPTION nthreads 1 0
use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).
ARGUMENT number 0 0 INT 0 9223372036854775807
OPTION config 1 1
temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.
ARGUMENT key 0 0 TEXT
ARGUMENT value 0 0 TEXT
OPTION help 1 0
display this information page and exit.
OPTION version 1 0
display version information and exit.
