Compute summary statistic on image intensities either across images, or along a specified axis of a single image
Supported operations are:
mean, median, sum, product, rms (root-mean-square value), norm (vector 2-norm), var (unbiased variance), std (unbiased standard deviation), min, max, absmax (maximum absolute value), magmax (value with maximum absolute value, preserving its sign).
This command is used to traverse either along an image axis, or across a set of input images, calculating some statistic from the values along each traversal. If you are seeking to instead perform mathematical calculations that are done independently for each voxel, pleaase see the 'mrcalc' command.
Calculate a 3D volume representing the mean intensity across a 4D image series: $ mrmath 4D.mif mean 3D_mean.mif -axis 3  This is a common operation for calculating e.g. the mean value within a specific DWI b-value. Note that axis indices start from 0; thus, axes 0, 1 & 2 are the three spatial axes, and axis 3 operates across volumes.
Generate a Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) along the inferior-superior direction: $ mrmath input.mif max MIP.mif -axis 2  Since a MIP is literally the maximal value along a specific projection direction, axis-aligned MIPs can be generated easily using mrmath with the 'max' operation.
ARGUMENT input 0 1 IMAGEIN
the input image(s).
ARGUMENT operation 0 0 CHOICE mean median sum product rms norm var std min max absmax magmax
the operation to apply, one of: mean, median, sum, product, rms, norm, var, std, min, max, absmax, magmax.
ARGUMENT output 0 0 IMAGEOUT
the output image.
OPTION axis 1 0
perform operation along a specified axis of a single input image
ARGUMENT index 0 0 INT 0 9223372036854775807
OPTION keep_unary_axes 1 0
Keep unary axes in input images prior to calculating the stats. The default is to wipe axes with single elements.
OPTION datatype 1 0
specify output image data type. Valid choices are: float16, float16le, float16be, float32, float32le, float32be, float64, float64le, float64be, int64, uint64, int64le, uint64le, int64be, uint64be, int32, uint32, int32le, uint32le, int32be, uint32be, int16, uint16, int16le, uint16le, int16be, uint16be, cfloat16, cfloat16le, cfloat16be, cfloat32, cfloat32le, cfloat32be, cfloat64, cfloat64le, cfloat64be, int8, uint8, bit.

OPTION info 1 0
display information messages.
OPTION quiet 1 0
do not display information messages or progress status; alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.
OPTION debug 1 0
display debugging messages.
OPTION force 1 0
force overwrite of output files (caution: using the same file as input and output might cause unexpected behaviour).
OPTION nthreads 1 0
use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).
ARGUMENT number 0 0 INT 0 9223372036854775807
OPTION config 1 1
temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.
ARGUMENT key 0 0 TEXT
ARGUMENT value 0 0 TEXT
OPTION help 1 0
display this information page and exit.
OPTION version 1 0
display version information and exit.
