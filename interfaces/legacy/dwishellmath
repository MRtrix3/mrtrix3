Apply an mrmath operation to each b-value shell in a DWI series
The output of this command is a 4D image, where each volume corresponds to a b-value shell (in order of increasing b-value), an the intensities within each volume correspond to the chosen statistic having been computed from across the DWI volumes belonging to that b-value shell.
To compute the mean diffusion-weighted signal in each b-value shell: $ dwishellmath dwi.mif mean shellmeans.mif
ARGUMENT input 0 0 IMAGEIN
The input diffusion MRI series
ARGUMENT operation 0 0 CHOICE mean median sum product rms norm var std min max absmax magmax
The operation to be applied to each shell; this must be one of the following: mean, median, sum, product, rms, norm, var, std, min, max, absmax, magmax
ARGUMENT output 0 0 IMAGEOUT
The output image series
OPTION -grad 1 0
Provide the diffusion gradient table in MRtrix format
ARGUMENT file 0 0 FILEIN
OPTION -fslgrad 1 0
Provide the diffusion gradient table in FSL bvecs/bvals format
ARGUMENT bvecs 0 0 FILEIN
ARGUMENT bvals 0 0 FILEIN
OPTION -nocleanup 1 0
do not delete intermediate files during script execution, and do not delete scratch directory at script completion.
OPTION -scratch 1 0
manually specify the path in which to generate the scratch directory.
ARGUMENT /path/to/scratch/ 0 0 DIROUT
OPTION -continue 1 0
continue the script from a previous execution; must provide the scratch directory path, and the name of the last successfully-generated file.
ARGUMENT ScratchDir 0 0 VARIOUS
ARGUMENT LastFile 0 0 VARIOUS
OPTION -info 1 0
display information messages.
OPTION -quiet 1 0
do not display information messages or progress status. Alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.
OPTION -debug 1 0
display debugging messages.
OPTION -force 1 0
force overwrite of output files.
OPTION -nthreads 1 0
use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).
ARGUMENT number 0 0 INT 0 9223372036854775807
OPTION -config 1 0
temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.
ARGUMENT key 0 0 TEXT
ARGUMENT value 0 0 TEXT
OPTION -help 1 0
display this information page and exit.
OPTION -version 1 0
display version information and exit.
