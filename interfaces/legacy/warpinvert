Invert a non-linear warp field
By default, this command assumes that the input warp field is a deformation field, i.e. each voxel stores the corresponding position in the other image (in scanner space), and the calculated output warp image will also be a deformation field. If the input warp field is instead a displacment field, i.e. where each voxel stores an offset from which to sample the other image (but still in scanner space), then the -displacement option should be used; the output warp field will additionally be calculated as a displacement field in this case.
ARGUMENT in 0 0 IMAGEIN
the input warp image.
ARGUMENT out 0 0 IMAGEOUT
the output warp image.
OPTION template 1 0
define a template image grid for the output warp
ARGUMENT image 0 0 IMAGEIN
OPTION displacement 1 0
indicates that the input warp field is a displacement field; the output will also be a displacement field
OPTION info 1 0
display information messages.
OPTION quiet 1 0
do not display information messages or progress status; alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.
OPTION debug 1 0
display debugging messages.
OPTION force 1 0
force overwrite of output files (caution: using the same file as input and output might cause unexpected behaviour).
OPTION nthreads 1 0
use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).
ARGUMENT number 0 0 INT 0 9223372036854775807
OPTION config 1 1
temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.
ARGUMENT key 0 0 TEXT
ARGUMENT value 0 0 TEXT
OPTION help 1 0
display this information page and exit.
OPTION version 1 0
display version information and exit.
