Generate a binary mask from DWI data
This script serves as an interface for many different algorithms that generate a binary mask from DWI data in different ways. Each algorithm available has its own help page, including necessary references; e.g. to see the help page of the "fslbet" algorithm, type "dwi2mask fslbet".
More information on mask derivation from DWI data can be found at the following link:
