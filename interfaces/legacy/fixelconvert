Convert between the old format fixel image (.msf / .msh) and the new fixel directory format
Fixel data are stored utilising the fixel directory format described in the main documentation, which can be found at the following link: 
https://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/3.0.4/fixel_based_analysis/fixel_directory_format.html
Convert from the old file format to the new directory format: $ fixelconvert old_fixels.msf new_fixels/ -out_size  This performs a simple conversion from old to new format, and additionally writes the contents of the "size" field within old-format fixel images stored using the "FixelMetric" class (likely all of them) as an additional fixel data file.
Convert multiple files from old to new format, preserving fixel correspondence: $ for_each *.msf : fixelconvert IN NAME_new/ -template template_fixels/  In this example, the for_each script is used to execute the fixelconvert command once for each of a series of input files in the old fixel format, generating a new output fixel directory for each.Importantly here though, the -template option is used to ensure that the ordering of fixels within these output directories is identical, such that fixel data files can be exchanged between them (e.g. accumulating fixel data files across subjects into a single template fixel directory
Convert from the new directory format to the old file format: $ fixelconvert new_fixels/ old_fixels.msf -value parameter.mif -in_size new_fixels/afd.mif  Conversion from the new directory format will contain the value 1.0 for all output fixels in both the "size" and "value" fields of the "FixelMetric" class, unless the -in_size and/or -value options are used respectively to indicate which fixel data files should be used as the source(s) of this information.
ARGUMENT fixel_in 0 0 VARIOUS
the input fixel file / directory.
