Generate a set of uniformly distributed directions using a bipolar electrostatic repulsion model
Directions are distributed by analogy to an electrostatic repulsion system, with each direction corresponding to a single electrostatic charge (for -unipolar), or a pair of diametrically opposed charges (for the default bipolar case). The energy of the system is determined based on the Coulomb repulsion, which assumes the form 1/r^power, where r is the distance between any pair of charges, and p is the power assumed for the repulsion law (default: 1). The minimum energy state is obtained by gradient descent.
ARGUMENT ndir 0 0 INT 6 2147483647
the number of directions to generate.
ARGUMENT dirs 0 0 FILEOUT
the text file to write the directions to, as [ az el ] pairs.
OPTION power 1 0
specify exponent to use for repulsion power law (default: 1). This must be a power of 2 (i.e. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...).
ARGUMENT exp 0 0 INT 1 2147483647
OPTION niter 1 0
specify the maximum number of iterations to perform (default: 10000).
ARGUMENT num 0 0 INT 1 2147483647
OPTION restarts 1 0
specify the number of restarts to perform (default: 10).
ARGUMENT num 0 0 INT 1 2147483647
OPTION unipolar 1 0
optimise assuming a unipolar electrostatic repulsion model rather than the bipolar model normally assumed in DWI
OPTION cartesian 1 0
Output the directions in Cartesian coordinates [x y z] instead of [az el].
OPTION info 1 0
display information messages.
OPTION quiet 1 0
do not display information messages or progress status; alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.
OPTION debug 1 0
display debugging messages.
OPTION force 1 0
force overwrite of output files (caution: using the same file as input and output might cause unexpected behaviour).
OPTION nthreads 1 0
use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).
ARGUMENT number 0 0 INT 0 9223372036854775807
OPTION config 1 1
temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.
ARGUMENT key 0 0 TEXT
ARGUMENT value 0 0 TEXT
OPTION help 1 0
display this information page and exit.
OPTION version 1 0
display version information and exit.
