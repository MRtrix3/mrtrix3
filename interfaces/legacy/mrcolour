Apply a colour map to an image
Under typical usage, this command will receive as input ad 3D greyscale image, and output a 4D image with 3 volumes corresponding to red-green-blue components; other use cases are possible, and are described in more detail below.
By default, the command will automatically determine the maximum and minimum intensities of the input image, and use that information to set the upper and lower bounds of the applied colourmap. This behaviour can be overridden by manually specifying these bounds using the -upper and -lower options respectively.
ARGUMENT input 0 0 IMAGEIN
the input image
ARGUMENT map 0 0 CHOICE gray hot cool jet inferno viridis pet colour rgb
the colourmap to apply; choices are: gray,hot,cool,jet,inferno,viridis,pet,colour,rgb
ARGUMENT output 0 0 IMAGEOUT
the output image
OPTION upper 1 0
manually set the upper intensity of the colour mapping
ARGUMENT value 0 0 FLOAT -inf inf
OPTION lower 1 0
manually set the lower intensity of the colour mapping
ARGUMENT value 0 0 FLOAT -inf inf
OPTION colour 1 0
set the target colour for use of the 'colour' map (three comma-separated floating-point values)
ARGUMENT values 0 0 FSEQ
OPTION info 1 0
display information messages.
OPTION quiet 1 0
do not display information messages or progress status; alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.
OPTION debug 1 0
display debugging messages.
OPTION force 1 0
force overwrite of output files (caution: using the same file as input and output might cause unexpected behaviour).
OPTION nthreads 1 0
use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).
ARGUMENT number 0 0 INT 0 9223372036854775807
OPTION config 1 1
temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.
ARGUMENT key 0 0 TEXT
ARGUMENT value 0 0 TEXT
OPTION help 1 0
