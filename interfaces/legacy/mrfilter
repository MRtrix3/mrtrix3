Perform filtering operations on 3D / 4D MR images
The available filters are: fft, gradient, median, smooth, normalise, zclean.
Each filter has its own unique set of optional parameters.
For 4D images, each 3D volume is processed independently.
ARGUMENT input 0 0 IMAGEIN
the input image.
ARGUMENT filter 0 0 CHOICE fft gradient median smooth normalise zclean
the type of filter to be applied
ARGUMENT output 0 0 IMAGEOUT
the output image.
OPTION axes 1 0
the axes along which to apply the Fourier Transform. By default, the transform is applied along the three spatial axes. Provide as a comma-separate list of axis indices.
ARGUMENT list 0 0 ISEQ
OPTION inverse 1 0
apply the inverse FFT
OPTION magnitude 1 0
output a magnitude image rather than a complex-valued image
OPTION rescale 1 0
rescale values so that inverse FFT recovers original values
OPTION centre_zero 1 0
re-arrange the FFT results so that the zero-frequency component appears in the centre of the image, rather than at the edges
OPTION stdev 1 0
the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel used to smooth the input image (in mm). The image is smoothed to reduced large spurious gradients caused by noise. Use this option to override the default stdev of 1 voxel. This can be specified either as a single value to be used for all 3 axes, or as a comma-separated list of 3 values, one for each axis.
ARGUMENT sigma 0 0 FSEQ
OPTION magnitude 1 0
output the gradient magnitude, rather than the default x,y,z components
OPTION scanner 1 0
define the gradient with respect to the scanner coordinate frame of reference.
OPTION extent 1 0
specify extent of median filtering neighbourhood in voxels. This can be specified either as a single value to be used for all 3 axes, or as a comma-separated list of 3 values, one for each axis (default: 3x3x3).
ARGUMENT size 0 0 ISEQ
OPTION extent 1 0
specify extent of normalisation filtering neighbourhood in voxels. This can be specified either as a single value to be used for all 3 axes, or as a comma-separated list of 3 values, one for each axis (default: 3x3x3).
ARGUMENT size 0 0 ISEQ
OPTION stdev 1 0
apply Gaussian smoothing with the specified standard deviation. The standard deviation is defined in mm (Default 1 voxel). This can be specified either as a single value to be used for all axes, or as a comma-separated list of the stdev for each axis.
ARGUMENT mm 0 0 FSEQ
OPTION fwhm 1 0
apply Gaussian smoothing with the specified full-width half maximum. The FWHM is defined in mm (Default 1 voxel * 2.3548). This can be specified either as a single value to be used for all axes, or as a comma-separated list of the FWHM for each axis.
ARGUMENT mm 0 0 FSEQ
OPTION extent 1 0
specify the extent (width) of kernel size in voxels. This can be specified either as a single value to be used for all axes, or as a comma-separated list of the extent for each axis. The default extent is 2 * ceil(2.5 * stdev / voxel_size) - 1.
ARGUMENT voxels 0 0 ISEQ
OPTION zupper 1 0
define high intensity outliers: default: 2.5
ARGUMENT num 0 0 FLOAT 0.1 inf
OPTION zlower 1 0
define low intensity outliers: default: 2.5
ARGUMENT num 0 0 FLOAT 0.1 inf
OPTION bridge 1 0
number of voxels to gap to fill holes in mask: default: 4
ARGUMENT num 0 0 INT 0 9223372036854775807
OPTION maskin 1 0
initial mask that defines the maximum spatial extent and the region from which to smaple the intensity range.
ARGUMENT image 0 0 IMAGEIN
OPTION maskout 1 0
Output a refined mask based on a spatially coherent region with normal intensity range.
ARGUMENT image 0 0 IMAGEOUT
OPTION strides 1 0
specify the strides of the output data in memory; either as a comma-separated list of (signed) integers, or as a template image from which the strides shall be extracted and used. The actual strides produced will depend on whether the output image format can support it.
ARGUMENT spec 0 0 VARIOUS
OPTION info 1 0
display information messages.
OPTION quiet 1 0
do not display information messages or progress status; alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.
OPTION debug 1 0
display debugging messages.
OPTION force 1 0
force overwrite of output files (caution: using the same file as input and output might cause unexpected behaviour).
OPTION nthreads 1 0
use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).
ARGUMENT number 0 0 INT 0 9223372036854775807
OPTION config 1 1
temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.
ARGUMENT key 0 0 TEXT
ARGUMENT value 0 0 TEXT
OPTION help 1 0
display this information page and exit.
OPTION version 1 0
display version information and exit.
