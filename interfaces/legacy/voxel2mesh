Generate a surface mesh representation from a voxel image
This command utilises the Marching Cubes algorithm to generate a polygonal surface that represents the isocontour(s) of the input image at a particular intensity. By default, an appropriate threshold will be determined automatically from the input image, however the intensity value of the isocontour(s) can instead be set manually using the -threhsold option.
If the -blocky option is used, then the Marching Cubes algorithm will not be used. Instead, the input image will be interpreted as a binary mask image, and polygonal surfaces will be generated at the outer faces of the voxel clusters within the mask.
ARGUMENT input 0 0 IMAGEIN
the input image.
ARGUMENT output 0 0 FILEOUT
the output mesh file.
OPTION blocky 1 0
generate a 'blocky' mesh that precisely represents the voxel edges
OPTION threshold 1 0
manually set the intensity threshold for the Marching Cubes algorithm
ARGUMENT value 0 0 FLOAT -inf inf
OPTION info 1 0
display information messages.
OPTION quiet 1 0
do not display information messages or progress status; alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.
OPTION debug 1 0
display debugging messages.
OPTION force 1 0
force overwrite of output files (caution: using the same file as input and output might cause unexpected behaviour).
OPTION nthreads 1 0
use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).
ARGUMENT number 0 0 INT 0 9223372036854775807
OPTION config 1 1
temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.
ARGUMENT key 0 0 TEXT
ARGUMENT value 0 0 TEXT
OPTION help 1 0
display this information page and exit.
OPTION version 1 0
display version information and exit.
