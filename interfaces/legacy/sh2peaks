Extract the peaks of a spherical harmonic function in each voxel
Peaks of the spherical harmonic function in each voxel are located by commencing a Newton search along each of a set of pre-specified directions
The spherical harmonic coefficients are stored according to the conventions described in the main documentation, which can be found at the following link:

ARGUMENT SH 0 0 IMAGEIN
the input image of SH coefficients.
ARGUMENT output 0 0 IMAGEOUT
the output image. Each volume corresponds to the x, y & z component of each peak direction vector in turn.
OPTION num 1 0
the number of peaks to extract (default: 3).
ARGUMENT peaks 0 0 INT 0 9223372036854775807
OPTION direction 1 1
the direction of a peak to estimate. The algorithm will attempt to find the same number of peaks as have been specified using this option.
ARGUMENT phi 0 0 FLOAT -inf inf
ARGUMENT theta 0 0 FLOAT -inf inf
OPTION peaks 1 0
the program will try to find the peaks that most closely match those in the image provided.
ARGUMENT image 0 0 IMAGEIN
OPTION threshold 1 0
only peak amplitudes greater than the threshold will be considered.
ARGUMENT value 0 0 FLOAT 0 inf
OPTION seeds 1 0
specify a set of directions from which to start the multiple restarts of the optimisation (by default, the built-in 60 direction set is used)
ARGUMENT file 0 0 FILEIN
OPTION mask 1 0
only perform computation within the specified binary brain mask image.
ARGUMENT image 0 0 IMAGEIN
OPTION fast 1 0
use lookup table to compute associated Legendre polynomials (faster, but approximate).
OPTION info 1 0
display information messages.
OPTION quiet 1 0
do not display information messages or progress status; alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.
OPTION debug 1 0
display debugging messages.
OPTION force 1 0
force overwrite of output files (caution: using the same file as input and output might cause unexpected behaviour).
OPTION nthreads 1 0
use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).
ARGUMENT number 0 0 INT 0 9223372036854775807
OPTION config 1 1
temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.
ARGUMENT key 0 0 TEXT
ARGUMENT value 0 0 TEXT
OPTION help 1 0
display this information page and exit.
OPTION version 1 0
display version information and exit.
