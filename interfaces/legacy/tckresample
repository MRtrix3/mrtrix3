Resample each streamline in a track file to a new set of vertices
It is necessary to specify precisely ONE of the command-line options for controlling how this resampling takes place; this may be either increasing or decreasing the number of samples along each streamline, or may involve changing the positions of the samples according to some specified trajectory.
Note that because the length of a streamline is calculated based on the sums of distances between adjacent vertices, resampling a streamline to a new set of vertices will typically change the quantified length of that streamline; the magnitude of the difference will typically depend on the discrepancy in the number of vertices, with less vertices leading to a shorter length (due to taking chordal lengths of curved trajectories).
ARGUMENT in_tracks 0 0 TRACKSIN
the input track file
ARGUMENT out_tracks 0 0 TRACKSOUT
the output resampled tracks
OPTION upsample 1 0
increase the density of points along the length of each streamline by some factor (may improve mapping streamlines to ROIs, and/or visualisation)
ARGUMENT ratio 0 0 INT 1 9223372036854775807
OPTION downsample 1 0
increase the density of points along the length of each streamline by some factor (decreases required storage space)
ARGUMENT ratio 0 0 INT 1 9223372036854775807
OPTION step_size 1 0
re-sample the streamlines to a desired step size (in mm)
ARGUMENT value 0 0 FLOAT 0 inf
OPTION num_points 1 0
re-sample each streamline to a fixed number of points
ARGUMENT count 0 0 INT 2 9223372036854775807
OPTION endpoints 1 0
only output the two endpoints of each streamline
OPTION line 1 0
resample tracks at 'num' equidistant locations along a line between 'start' and 'end' (specified as comma-separated 3-vectors in scanner coordinates)
ARGUMENT num 0 0 INT 2 9223372036854775807
ARGUMENT start 0 0 FSEQ
ARGUMENT end 0 0 FSEQ
OPTION arc 1 0
resample tracks at 'num' equidistant locations along a circular arc specified by points 'start', 'mid' and 'end' (specified as comma-separated 3-vectors in scanner coordinates)

OPTION info 1 0
display information messages.
OPTION quiet 1 0
do not display information messages or progress status; alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.
OPTION debug 1 0
display debugging messages.
OPTION force 1 0
force overwrite of output files (caution: using the same file as input and output might cause unexpected behaviour).
OPTION nthreads 1 0
use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).

temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.
ARGUMENT key 0 0 TEXT
ARGUMENT value 0 0 TEXT
OPTION help 1 0
display this information page and exit.
OPTION version 1 0
display version information and exit.
