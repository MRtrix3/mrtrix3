Perform DWI bias field correction using the "fast" command as provided in FSL
The FSL "fast" command only estimates the bias field within a brain mask, and cannot extrapolate this smoothly-varying field beyond the defined mask. As such, this algorithm by necessity introduces a hard masking of the input DWI. Since this attribute may interfere with the purpose of using the command (e.g. correction of a bias field is commonly used to improve brain mask estimation), use of this particular algorithm is generally not recommended.
ARGUMENT input 0 0 IMAGEIN
The input image series to be corrected
ARGUMENT output 0 0 IMAGEOUT
The output corrected image series
OPTION -grad 1 0
Provide the diffusion gradient table in MRtrix format
ARGUMENT file 0 0 FILEIN
OPTION -fslgrad 1 0
Provide the diffusion gradient table in FSL bvecs/bvals format
ARGUMENT bvecs 0 0 FILEIN
ARGUMENT bvals 0 0 FILEIN
OPTION -mask 1 0
Manually provide an input mask image for bias field estimation
ARGUMENT image 0 0 IMAGEIN
OPTION -bias 1 0
Output an image containing the estimated bias field
ARGUMENT image 0 0 IMAGEOUT
OPTION -nocleanup 1 0
do not delete intermediate files during script execution, and do not delete scratch directory at script completion.
OPTION -scratch 1 0
manually specify the path in which to generate the scratch directory.
ARGUMENT /path/to/scratch/ 0 0 DIROUT
OPTION -continue 1 0
continue the script from a previous execution; must provide the scratch directory path, and the name of the last successfully-generated file.
