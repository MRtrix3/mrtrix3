Perform filtering operations on 3D / 4D mask images
Many filters have their own unique set of optional parameters; see the option groups dedicated to each filter type.
ARGUMENT input 0 0 IMAGEIN
the input mask.
ARGUMENT filter 0 0 CHOICE clean connect dilate erode fill median
the name of the filter to be applied; options are: clean, connect, dilate, erode, fill, median
ARGUMENT output 0 0 IMAGEOUT
the output mask.
OPTION scale 1 0
the maximum scale used to cut bridges. A certain maximum scale cuts bridges up to a width (in voxels) of 2x the provided scale. (Default: 2)
ARGUMENT value 0 0 INT 1 1000000
OPTION axes 1 0
specify which axes should be included in the connected components. By default only the first 3 axes are included. The axes should be provided as a comma-separated list of values.
ARGUMENT axes 0 0 ISEQ
OPTION largest 1 0
only retain the largest connected component
OPTION connectivity 1 0
use 26-voxel-neighbourhood connectivity (Default: 6)
OPTION minsize 1 0
impose minimum size of segmented components (Default: select all components)
ARGUMENT value 0 0 INT 1 1000000
OPTION npass 1 0
the number of times to repeatedly apply the filter
ARGUMENT value 0 0 INT 1 1000000
OPTION axes 1 0
specify which axes should be included in the connected components. By default only the first 3 axes are included. The axes should be provided as a comma-separated list of values.
ARGUMENT axes 0 0 ISEQ
OPTION connectivity 1 0
use 26-voxel-neighbourhood connectivity (Default: 6)
OPTION extent 1 0
specify the extent (width) of kernel size in voxels. This can be specified either as a single value to be used for all axes, or as a comma-separated list of the extent for each axis. The default is 3x3x3.
ARGUMENT voxels 0 0 ISEQ
OPTION strides 1 0
specify the strides of the output data in memory; either as a comma-separated list of (signed) integers, or as a template image from which the strides shall be extracted and used. The actual strides produced will depend on whether the output image format can support it.
ARGUMENT spec 0 0 VARIOUS
OPTION info 1 0
display information messages.
OPTION quiet 1 0
do not display information messages or progress status; alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.
OPTION debug 1 0
display debugging messages.
OPTION force 1 0
force overwrite of output files (caution: using the same file as input and output might cause unexpected behaviour).
OPTION nthreads 1 0
use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).
ARGUMENT number 0 0 INT 0 9223372036854775807
OPTION config 1 1
temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.
ARGUMENT key 0 0 TEXT
ARGUMENT value 0 0 TEXT
OPTION help 1 0
display this information page and exit.
OPTION version 1 0
display version information and exit.
