Register two images together using a symmetric rigid, affine or non-linear transformation model
By default this application will perform an affine, followed by non-linear registration.
FOD registration (with apodised point spread reorientation) will be performed by default if the number of volumes in the 4th dimension equals the number of coefficients in an antipodally symmetric spherical harmonic series (e.g. 6, 15, 28 etc). The -no_reorientation option can be used to force reorientation off if required.
Non-linear registration computes warps to map from both image1->image2 and image2->image1. Similar to Avants (2008) Med Image Anal. 12(1): 26â€“41, registration is performed by matching both the image1 and image2 in a 'midway space'. Warps can be saved as two deformation fields that map directly between image1->image2 and image2->image1, or if using -nl_warp_full as a single 5D file that stores all 4 warps image1->mid->image2, and image2->mid->image1. The 5D warp format stores x,y,z deformations in the 4th dimension, and uses the 5th dimension to index the 4 warps. The affine transforms estimated (to midway space) are also stored as comments in the image header. The 5D warp file can be used to reinitialise subsequent registrations, in addition to transforming images to midway space (e.g. for intra-subject alignment in a 2-time-point longitudinal analysis).
