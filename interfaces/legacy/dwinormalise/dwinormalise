Perform various forms of intensity normalisation of DWIs
This script provides access to different techniques for globally scaling the intensity of diffusion-weighted images. The different algorithms have different purposes, and different requirements with respect to the data with which they must be provided & will produce as output. Further information on the individual algorithms available can be accessed via their individual help pages; eg. "dwinormalise group -help".
ARGUMENT algorithm CHOICE group manual mtnorm
OPTION -nocleanup 1 0
do not delete intermediate files during script execution, and do not delete scratch directory at script completion.
OPTION -scratch 1 0
manually specify the path in which to generate the scratch directory.
ARGUMENT /path/to/scratch/ 0 0 DIROUT
OPTION -continue 1 0
continue the script from a previous execution; must provide the scratch directory path, and the name of the last successfully-generated file.

OPTION -quiet 1 0
do not display information messages or progress status. Alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.
OPTION -debug 1 0
display debugging messages.
OPTION -force 1 0
force overwrite of output files.
OPTION -nthreads 1 0
