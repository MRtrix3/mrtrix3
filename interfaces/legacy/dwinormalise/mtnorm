Normalise a DWI series to the estimated b=0 CSF intensity
This algorithm determines an appropriate global scaling factor to apply to a DWI series such that after the scaling is applied, the b=0 CSF intensity corresponds to some reference value (1000 by default).
The operation of this script is a subset of that performed by the script "dwibiasnormmask". Many users may find that comprehensive solution preferable; this dwinormalise algorithm is nevertheless provided to demonstrate specifically the global intensituy normalisation portion of that command.
The ODFs estimated within this optimisation procedure are by default of lower maximal spherical harmonic degree than what would be advised for analysis. This is done for computational efficiency. This behaviour can be modified through the -lmax command-line option.
ARGUMENT input 0 0 IMAGEIN
The input DWI series
ARGUMENT output 0 0 IMAGEOUT
The normalised DWI series
OPTION -grad 1 0
Provide the diffusion gradient table in MRtrix format
ARGUMENT file 0 0 FILEIN
OPTION -fslgrad 1 0
Provide the diffusion gradient table in FSL bvecs/bvals format
ARGUMENT bvecs 0 0 FILEIN
ARGUMENT bvals 0 0 FILEIN
OPTION -lmax 1 0
The maximum spherical harmonic degree for the estimated FODs (see Description); defaults are "4,0,0" for multi-shell and "4,0" for single-shell data)
ARGUMENT values 0 0 ISEQ
OPTION -mask 1 0
Provide a mask image for relevant calculations (if not provided, the default dwi2mask algorithm will be used)
ARGUMENT image 0 0 IMAGEIN
OPTION -reference 1 0
Set the target CSF b=0 intensity in the output DWI series (default: 1000)
ARGUMENT value 0 0 FLOAT 0.0 inf
OPTION -scale 1 0
Write the scaling factor applied to the DWI series to a text file
ARGUMENT file 0 0 FILEOUT
OPTION -nocleanup 1 0
do not delete intermediate files during script execution, and do not delete scratch directory at script completion.
OPTION -scratch 1 0
manually specify the path in which to generate the scratch directory.
ARGUMENT /path/to/scratch/ 0 0 DIROUT
