Map the scalar value in each voxel to all fixels within that voxel
This command is designed to enable CFE-based statistical analysis to be performed on voxel-wise measures.
Fixel data are stored utilising the fixel directory format described in the main documentation, which can be found at the following link: 
https://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/3.0.4/fixel_based_analysis/fixel_directory_format.html
ARGUMENT image_in 0 0 IMAGEIN
the input image.
ARGUMENT fixel_directory_in 0 0 DIRIN
the input fixel directory. Used to define the fixels and their directions
ARGUMENT fixel_directory_out 0 0 TEXT
the fixel directory where the output will be written. This can be the same as the input directory if desired
ARGUMENT fixel_data_out 0 0 TEXT
the name of the fixel data image.
OPTION info 1 0
display information messages.
OPTION quiet 1 0
do not display information messages or progress status; alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.
OPTION debug 1 0
display debugging messages.
OPTION force 1 0
force overwrite of output files (caution: using the same file as input and output might cause unexpected behaviour).
OPTION nthreads 1 0
use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).
ARGUMENT number 0 0 INT 0 9223372036854775807
OPTION config 1 1
temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.
ARGUMENT key 0 0 TEXT
ARGUMENT value 0 0 TEXT
OPTION help 1 0
display this information page and exit.
OPTION version 1 0
display version information and exit.
