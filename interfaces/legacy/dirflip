Invert the polarity of individual directions so as to optimise a unipolar electrostatic repulsion model
The orientations themselves are not affected, only their polarity; this is necessary to ensure near-optimal distribution of DW directions for eddy-current correction.
ARGUMENT in 0 0 FILEIN
the input files for the directions.
ARGUMENT out 0 0 FILEOUT
the output files for the directions.
OPTION permutations 1 0
number of permutations to try (default: 100000000)
ARGUMENT num 0 0 INT 1 9223372036854775807
OPTION cartesian 1 0
Output the directions in Cartesian coordinates [x y z] instead of [az el].
OPTION info 1 0
display information messages.
OPTION quiet 1 0
do not display information messages or progress status; alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.
OPTION debug 1 0
display debugging messages.
OPTION force 1 0
force overwrite of output files (caution: using the same file as input and output might cause unexpected behaviour).
OPTION nthreads 1 0
use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).
ARGUMENT number 0 0 INT 0 9223372036854775807
OPTION config 1 1
temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.
ARGUMENT key 0 0 TEXT
ARGUMENT value 0 0 TEXT
OPTION help 1 0
display this information page and exit.
OPTION version 1 0
display version information and exit.
