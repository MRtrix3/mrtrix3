Perform spherical convolution
Provided with matching pairs of response function and ODF images (containing SH coefficients), perform spherical convolution to provide the corresponding SH coefficients of the signal.
If multiple pairs of inputs are provided, their contributions will be summed into a single output.
If the responses are multi-shell (with one line of coefficients per shell), the output will be a 5-dimensional image, with the SH coefficients of the signal in each shell stored at different indices along the 5th dimension.
The spherical harmonic coefficients are stored according to the conventions described in the main documentation, which can be found at the following link:

ARGUMENT odf response 0 1 
pairs of input ODF image and corresponding responses
ARGUMENT SH_out 0 0 IMAGEOUT
the output spherical harmonics coefficients image.
OPTION datatype 1 0
specify output image data type. Valid choices are: float16, float16le, float16be, float32, float32le, float32be, float64, float64le, float64be, int64, uint64, int64le, uint64le, int64be, uint64be, int32, uint32, int32le, uint32le, int32be, uint32be, int16, uint16, int16le, uint16le, int16be, uint16be, cfloat16, cfloat16le, cfloat16be, cfloat32, cfloat32le, cfloat32be, cfloat64, cfloat64le, cfloat64be, int8, uint8, bit.
ARGUMENT spec 0 0 CHOICE float16 float16le float16be float32 float32le float32be float64 float64le float64be int64 uint64 int64le uint64le int64be uint64be int32 uint32 int32le uint32le int32be uint32be int16 uint16 int16le uint16le int16be uint16be cfloat16 cfloat16le cfloat16be cfloat32 cfloat32le cfloat32be cfloat64 cfloat64le cfloat64be int8 uint8 bit
OPTION strides 1 0
specify the strides of the output data in memory; either as a comma-separated list of (signed) integers, or as a template image from which the strides shall be extracted and used. The actual strides produced will depend on whether the output image format can support it.
ARGUMENT spec 0 0 VARIOUS
OPTION info 1 0
display information messages.
OPTION quiet 1 0
do not display information messages or progress status; alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.
OPTION debug 1 0
display debugging messages.
OPTION force 1 0
force overwrite of output files (caution: using the same file as input and output might cause unexpected behaviour).
OPTION nthreads 1 0
use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).
ARGUMENT number 0 0 INT 0 9223372036854775807
OPTION config 1 1
temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.
ARGUMENT key 0 0 TEXT
ARGUMENT value 0 0 TEXT
OPTION help 1 0
display this information page and exit.
OPTION version 1 0
display version information and exit.
