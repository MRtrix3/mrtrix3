Compute the total power of a spherical harmonics image
This command computes the sum of squared SH coefficients, which equals the mean-squared amplitude of the spherical function it represents.
The spherical harmonic coefficients are stored according to the conventions described in the main documentation, which can be found at the following link:

ARGUMENT SH 0 0 IMAGEIN
the input spherical harmonics coefficients image.
ARGUMENT power 0 0 IMAGEOUT
the output power image.
OPTION spectrum 1 0
output the power spectrum, i.e., the power contained within each harmonic degree (l=0, 2, 4, ...) as a 4-D image.
OPTION info 1 0
display information messages.
OPTION quiet 1 0
do not display information messages or progress status; alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.
OPTION debug 1 0
display debugging messages.
OPTION force 1 0
force overwrite of output files (caution: using the same file as input and output might cause unexpected behaviour).
OPTION nthreads 1 0
use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).
ARGUMENT number 0 0 INT 0 9223372036854775807
OPTION config 1 1
temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.
ARGUMENT key 0 0 TEXT
ARGUMENT value 0 0 TEXT
OPTION help 1 0
display this information page and exit.
OPTION version 1 0
display version information and exit.
