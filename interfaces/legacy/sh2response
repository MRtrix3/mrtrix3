Generate an appropriate response function from the image data for spherical deconvolution
The spherical harmonic coefficients are stored according to the conventions described in the main documentation, which can be found at the following link: 
https://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/3.0.4/concepts/spherical_harmonics.html
ARGUMENT SH 0 0 IMAGEIN
the spherical harmonic decomposition of the diffusion-weighted images
ARGUMENT mask 0 0 IMAGEIN
the mask containing the voxels from which to estimate the response function
ARGUMENT directions 0 0 IMAGEIN
a 4D image containing the direction vectors along which to estimate the response function
ARGUMENT response 0 0 FILEOUT
the output axially-symmetric spherical harmonic coefficients
OPTION lmax 1 0
specify the maximum harmonic degree of the response function to estimate
ARGUMENT value 0 0 INT 0 20
OPTION dump 1 0
dump the m=0 SH coefficients from all voxels in the mask to the output file, rather than their mean
ARGUMENT file 0 0 FILEOUT
OPTION info 1 0
display information messages.
OPTION quiet 1 0
do not display information messages or progress status; alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.
OPTION debug 1 0
display debugging messages.
OPTION force 1 0
force overwrite of output files (caution: using the same file as input and output might cause unexpected behaviour).
OPTION nthreads 1 0
use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).
ARGUMENT number 0 0 INT 0 9223372036854775807
OPTION config 1 1
temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.
ARGUMENT key 0 0 TEXT
ARGUMENT value 0 0 TEXT
OPTION help 1 0
display this information page and exit.
OPTION version 1 0
display version information and exit.
