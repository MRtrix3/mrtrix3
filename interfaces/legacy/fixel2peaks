Convert data in the fixel directory format into a 4D image of 3-vectors
If a fixel data file is provided as input, then the 3-vectors in the output image will be scaled based on the data in that file. If the input is instead the fixel directory, or the index or directions file, then all output 3-vectors will possess unit norm.
Fixel data are stored utilising the fixel directory format described in the main documentation, which can be found at the following link: 
https://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/3.0.4/fixel_based_analysis/fixel_directory_format.html
ARGUMENT in 0 0 VARIOUS
the input fixel information
ARGUMENT out 0 0 IMAGEOUT
the output peaks image
OPTION number 1 0
maximum number of fixels in each voxel (default: based on input data)
ARGUMENT value 0 0 INT 1 9223372036854775807
OPTION nan 1 0
fill excess peak data with NaNs rather than zeroes
OPTION info 1 0
display information messages.
OPTION quiet 1 0
do not display information messages or progress status; alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.
OPTION debug 1 0
display debugging messages.
OPTION force 1 0
force overwrite of output files (caution: using the same file as input and output might cause unexpected behaviour).
OPTION nthreads 1 0
use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).
ARGUMENT number 0 0 INT 0 9223372036854775807
OPTION config 1 1
temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.
ARGUMENT key 0 0 TEXT
ARGUMENT value 0 0 TEXT
OPTION help 1 0
display this information page and exit.
OPTION version 1 0
display version information and exit.
