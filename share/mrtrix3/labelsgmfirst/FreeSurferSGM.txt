# This file is used to extract sub-cortical structures from FreeSurfer segmentations

# Previously, the labelsgmfirst command was compatible with both FreeSurfer LUT files and connectome config files, as the first two columns were identical.
# Now, this command ideally needs to be compatible with LUT files in any format.

# This is solved in the following way:
# * Create a new image for sub-cortical structures using the output of FIRST and these indices.
# * Convert that image to the indices of the original lookup table using labelconvert.
# * Use mrstats to 'discover' what index each structure has been assigned to.
# * For each index in the original image, strip out any voxels corresponding to any of these values.
# * Also zero any voxels that coincide with any of the new SGM estimates.
# * Add the re-indexed SGM image to the stripped input image.
