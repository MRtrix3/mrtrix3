  AUTHOR = "Robert E. Smith (robert.smith@florey.edu.au)";

  SYNOPSIS = "Perform various editing operations on track files";

  DESCRIPTION
  + "This command can be used to perform various types of manipulations "
    "on track data. A range of such manipulations are demonstrated in the "
    "examples provided below."

  + DWI::Tractography::preserve_track_order_desc;

  EXAMPLES
  + Example ("Concatenate data from multiple track files into one",
             "tckedit *.tck all_tracks.tck",
             "Here the wildcard operator is used to select all files in the "
             "current working directory that have the .tck filetype suffix; but "
             "input files can equivalently be specified one at a time explicitly.")

  + Example ("Extract a reduced number of streamlines",
             "tckedit in_many.tck out_few.tck -number 1k -skip 500",
             "The number of streamlines requested would typically be less "
             "than the number of streamlines in the input track file(s); if it "
             "is instead greater, then the command will issue a warning upon "
             "completion. By default the streamlines for the output file are "
             "extracted from the start of the input file(s); in this example the "
             "command is instead instructed to skip the first 500 streamlines, and "
             "write to the output file streamlines 501-1500.")

  + Example ("Extract streamlines based on selection criteria",
             "tckedit in.tck out.tck -include ROI1.mif -include ROI2.mif -minlength 25",
             "Multiple criteria can be added in a single invocation of tckedit, "
             "and a streamline must satisfy all criteria imposed in order to be "
             "written to the output file. Note that both -include and -exclude "
             "options can be specified multiple times to provide multiple "
             "waypoints / exclusion masks.")

  + Example ("Select only those streamline vertices within a mask",
             "tckedit in.tck cropped.tck -mask mask.mif",
             "The -mask option is applied to each streamline vertex independently, "
             "rather than to each streamline, retaining only those streamline vertices "
             "within the mask. As such, use of this option may result in a greater "
             "number of output streamlines than input streamlines, as a single input "
             "streamline may have the vertices at either endpoint retained but some "
             "vertices at its midpoint removed, effectively cutting one long streamline "
             "into multiple shorter streamlines.");



  ARGUMENTS
  + Argument ("tracks_in",  "the input track file(s)").type_tracks_in().allow_multiple()

                       "i.e. only those streamlines that fail at least one criterion will be written to file.")

  + Option ("ends_only", "only test the ends of each streamline against the provided include/exclude ROIs")
