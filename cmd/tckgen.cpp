  SYNOPSIS = "Perform streamlines tractography";

  DESCRIPTION 
    + "By default, tckgen produces a fixed number of streamlines, by attempting "
      "to seed from new random locations until the target number of "
      "streamlines have been selected (in other words, after all inclusion & "
      "exclusion criteria have been applied), or the maximum number of seeds "
      "has been exceeded (by default, this is 1000Ã— the desired number of selected "
      "streamlines). Use the -select and/or -seeds options to modify as "
      "required. See also the Seeding options section for alternative seeding "
      "strategies."

    + "Below is a list of available tracking algorithms, the input image data "
      "that they require, and a brief description of their behaviour:"

    + "- FACT: Fiber Assigned by Continuous Tracking. A deterministic algorithm that "
      "takes as input a 4D image, with 3xN volumes, where N is the maximum number "
      "of fiber orientations in a voxel. Each triplet of volumes represents a 3D "
      "vector corresponding to a fiber orientation; the length of the vector "
      "additionally indicates some measure of density or anisotropy. As streamlines "
      "move from one voxel to another, the fiber orientation most collinear with the "
      "streamline orientation is selected (i.e. there is no intra-voxel interpolation)."

    + "- iFOD1: First-order Integration over Fiber Orientation Distributions. A "
      "probabilistic algorithm that takes as input a Fiber Orientation Distribution "
      "(FOD) image represented in the Spherical Harmonic (SH) basis. At each "
      "streamline step, random samples from the local (trilinear interpolated) FOD "
      "are taken. A streamline is more probable to follow orientations where the FOD "
      "amplitude is large; but it may also rarely traverse orientations with small "
      "FOD amplitude."

    + "- iFOD2 (default): Second-order Integration over Fiber Orientation "
      "Distributions. A probabilistic algorithm that takes as input a Fiber "
      "Orientation Distribution (FOD) image represented in the Spherical Harmonic "
      "(SH) basis. Candidate streamline paths (based on short curved \"arcs\") are "
      "drawn, and the underlying (trilinear-interpolated) FOD amplitudes along those "
      "arcs are sampled. A streamline is more probable to follow a path where the FOD "
      "amplitudes along that path are large; but it may also rarely traverse "
      "orientations where the FOD amplitudes are small, as long as the amplitude "
      "remains above the FOD amplitude threshold along the entire path."

    + "- NullDist1 / NullDist2: Null Distribution tracking algorithms. These "
      "probabilistic algorithms expect as input the same image that was used when "
      "invoking the corresponding algorithm for which the null distribution is "
      "sought. These algorithms generate streamlines based on random orientation "
      "samples; that is, no image information relating to fiber orientations is used, "
      "and streamlines trajectories are determined entirely from random sampling. "
      "The NullDist2 algorithm is designed to be used in conjunction with iFOD2; "
      "NullDist1 should be used in conjunction with any first-order algorithm."

    + "- SD_STREAM: Streamlines tractography based on Spherical Deconvolution (SD). "
      "A deterministic algorithm that takes as input a Fiber Orientation Distribution "
      "(FOD) image represented in the Spherical Harmonic (SH) basis. At each "
      "streamline step, the local (trilinear-interpolated) FOD is sampled, and from "
      "the current streamline tangent orientation, a Newton optimisation on the "
      "sphere is performed in order to locate the orientation of the nearest FOD "
      "amplitude peak."

    + "- SeedTest: A dummy streamlines algorithm used for testing streamline seeding "
      "mechanisms. Any image can be used as input; the image will not be used in any "
      "way. For each seed point generated by the seeding mechanism(s), a streamline "
      "containing a single point corresponding to that seed location will be written "
      "to the output track file."

    + "- Tensor_Det: A deterministic algorithm that takes as input a 4D "
      "diffusion-weighted image (DWI) series. At each streamline step, the diffusion "
      "tensor is fitted to the local (trilinear-interpolated) diffusion data, and "
      "the streamline trajectory is determined as the principal eigenvector of that "
      "tensor."

    + "- Tensor_Prob: A probabilistic algorithm that takes as input a 4D "
      "diffusion-weighted image (DWI) series. Within each image voxel, a residual "
      "bootstrap is performed to obtain a unique realisation of the DWI data in that "
      "voxel for each streamline. These data are then sampled via trilinear "
      "interpolation at each streamline step, the diffusion tensor model is fitted, "
      "and the streamline follows the orientation of the principal eigenvector of "
      "that tensor.";
