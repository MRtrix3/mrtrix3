  SYNOPSIS = "The MRtrix image viewer.";

  DESCRIPTION
  + "Any images listed as arguments will be loaded and available through the "
    "image menu, with the first listed displayed initially. Any subsequent "
    "command-line options will be processed as if the corresponding action had "
    "been performed through the GUI."

  + "Note that because images loaded as arguments (i.e. simply listed on the "
    "command-line) are opened before the GUI is shown, subsequent actions to be "
    "performed via the various command-line options must appear after the last "
    "argument. This is to avoid confusion about which option will apply to which "
    "image. If you need fine control over this, please use the -load or -select_image "
    "options. For example:"

  + "$ mrview -load image1.mif -interpolation 0 -load image2.mif -interpolation 0"

  + "or"

  + "$ mrview image1.mif image2.mif -interpolation 0 -select_image 2 -interpolation 0";
