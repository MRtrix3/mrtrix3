<p>
MRtrix provides a set of tools to perform diffusion-weighted MRI white matter tractography in the presence of crossing fibres,
using Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (<a href='appendix/refs.html#tournier1'>Tournier <i>et al.</i>. 2004</a>; 
<a href='appendix/refs.html#tournier2'>Tournier <i>et al.</i> 2007</a>), 
and a probabilisitic streamlines algorithm (e.g. <a href='appendix/refs.html#behrens'>Behrens <i>et al.</i>, 2003</a>; 
<a href='appendix/refs.html#parker'>Parker <i>et al.</i>, 2003</a>).
These applications have been written from scratch in C++, using the functionality provided
by the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/">GNU Scientific Library</a>,
and <a href="http://www.gtkmm.org/">gtkmm</a>.
The software is currently capable of handling <a href="http://medical.nema.org/">DICOM</a> and 
<a href="http://www.mayo.edu/bir/Software/Analyze/AnalyzeTechInfo.html">AnalyseAVW</a> image formats, amongst others.

<h2><a name='conventions'>Conventions used in this manual</a></h2>
<p>
This manual contains many examples which can be typed at the keyboard. A command entered at the terminal is shown like this:
</p>
<pre>
&gt; <b>command</b>
</pre>
<p>
The first character on the line is the terminal prompt, and should not be typed. 
The greater-than sign '&gt;' is used as the standard prompt in this manual, although some systems may use a different character.
</p>
<p>
The text that is actually typed at the keyboard is shown in <code><b>bold</b></code>.
Any output produced by the program will be displayed in a <code>standard font</code>.
<p>
In certain cases (e.g. at installation), the number sign '#' is shown as the terminal prompt. 
In such cases, the command is expected to be executed with administrative (root) privileges.
</p>
<p>
These examples are for demonstation purposes only: depending on your specific aims and applications,
you may want to omit some of the steps shown, or you may need to perform additional steps.
</p>
<p>
This manual assumes a GNU/Unix environment. There may be minor differences in the input or output on other systems,
and you may need to edit the commands to suit your working environment. 
For example, in Microsoft Windows, you will need to use the backslash <kbd>'\'</kbd> as the directory separator.
