    "-aggregation exclusive corresponds to the behaviour of the dwidenoise command in version 3.0.x, "
    "where the output intensities for a given image voxel are determined exclusively "

    "In all other use cases, so-called \"overcomplete local PCA\" is performed, "
    "where the intensities for an output image voxel are some combination of all PCA decompositions "
    "for which that voxel is included in the local spatial kernel. "
    "There are multiple algebraic forms that modulate the weight with which each decomposition "
    "contributes with greater or lesser strength toward the output image intensities. "
    "The various options are: "
    "'gaussian': A Gaussian distribution with FWHM equal to twice the voxel size, "
    "such that decompisitions centred more closely to the output voxel have greater influence; "
    "'invl0': The inverse of the L0 norm (ie. rank) of each decomposition, "
    "as used in Manjon et al. 2013; "
    "'rank': The rank of each decomposition, "
    "such that high-rank decompositions contribute more strongly to the output intensities "
    "regardless of distance between the output voxel and the centre of the decomposition kernel; "
    "'uniform': All decompositions that include the output voxel in the sliding spatial window contribute equally.";
