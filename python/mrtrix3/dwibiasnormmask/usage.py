  cmdline.set_synopsis('Perform a combination of bias field correction, intensity normalisation, and mask derivation, for DWI data')
  cmdline.add_description('DWI bias field correction, intensity normalisation and masking are inter-related steps, and errors '
                          'in each may influence other steps. This script is designed to perform all of these steps in an integrated '
                          'iterative fashion, with the intention of making all steps more robust.')
  cmdline.add_description('The operation of the algorithm is as follows. An initial mask is defined, either using the default dwi2mask '
                          'algorithm or as provided by the user. Based on this mask, a sequence of response function estimation, '
                          'multi-shell multi-tissue CSD, bias field correction (using the mtnormalise command), and intensity '
                          'normalisation is performed. The default dwi2mask algorithm is then re-executed on the bias-field-corrected '
                          'DWI series. This sequence of steps is then repeated based on the revised mask, until either a convergence '
                          'criterion or some number of maximum iterations is reached.')
  cmdline.add_description('The MRtrix3 mtnormalise command is used to estimate information relating to bias field and intensity '
                          'normalisation. However its usage in this context is different to its conventional usage. Firstly, '
                          'while the corrected ODF images are typically used directly following invocation of this command, '
                          'here the estimated bias field and scaling factors are instead used to apply the relevant corrections to '
                          'the originating DWI data. Secondly, the global intensity scaling that is calculated and applied is '
                          'typically based on achieving close to a unity sum of tissue signal fractions throughout the masked region. '
                          'Here, it is instead the b=0 signal in CSF that forms the reference for this global intensity scaling; '
                          'this is calculated based on the estimated CSF response function and the tissue-specific intensity '
                          'scaling (this is calculated internally by mtnormalise as part of its optimisation process, but typically '
                          'subsequently discarded in favour of a single scaling factor for all tissues)')
  cmdline.add_description('The ODFs estimated within this optimisation procedure are by default of lower maximal spherical harmonic '
                          'degree than what would be advised for analysis. This is done for computational efficiency. This '
                          'behaviour can be modified through the -lmax command-line option.')
  cmdline.add_description('By default, the optimisation procedure will terminate after only two iterations. This is done because '
                          'it has been observed for some data / configurations that additional iterations can lead to unstable '
                          'divergence and erroneous results for bias field estimation and masking. For other configurations, '
                          'it may be preferable to use a greater number of iterations, and allow the iterative algorithm to '
                          'converge to a stable solution. This can be controlled via the -max_iters command-line option.')
  cmdline.add_description('Within the optimisation algorithm, derivation of the mask may potentially be performed differently to '
                          'a conventional mask derivation that is based on a DWI series (where, in many instances, it is actually '
                          'only the mean b=0 image that is used). Here, the image corresponding to the sum of tissue signal fractions '
                          'following spherical deconvolution / bias field correction / intensity normalisation is also available, '
                          'and this can potentially be used for mask derivation. Available options are as follows. '
                          '"dwi2mask": Use the MRtrix3 command dwi2mask on the bias-field-corrected DWI series '
                          '(ie. do not use the ODF tissue sum image for mask derivation); '
                          'the algorithm to be invoked can be controlled by the user via the MRtrix config file entry "Dwi2maskAlgorithm". '
                          '"fslbet": Invoke the FSL command "bet" on the ODF tissue sum image. '

                          '(and some heuristic cleanup of the resulting mask will be performed). '
                          '"synthstrip": Invoke the FreeSurfer SynthStrip method on the ODF tissue sum image. '
                          '"threshold": Apply a fixed partial volume threshold of 0.5 to the ODF tissue sum image '
