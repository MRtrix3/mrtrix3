# Verify correct operation of the "RGB" colour map
# The purpose of this operation is merely to take an image that is already a 4D series with 3 volumes
#   (and can therefore be interpreted as an RGB image),
#   and apply the requisite min-max scaling to put the intensities in the [0.0, 1.0] range
#   and therefore be compatible with writing to a format such as PNG.
# The same set of operations is achieved using other MRtrix3 commands,
#   and the test ensures that the two outcomes are identical.
