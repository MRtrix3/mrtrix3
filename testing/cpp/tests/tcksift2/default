# Verify operation of the SIFT2 algorithm on a phantom with known structure & reconstruction density bias
# Based on the difference in lengths of the two bundles,
#   and the use of homogeneous seeding during tractogram construction,
#   the longer bundle presents more volume from which to seed
#   and therefore contains a larger number of streamlines in the tractogram.
# It is expected that when the per-streamline weights calculated by SIFT2
#   are used to modulate the contribution of each streamline to a density map,
#   the densities of the long and short bundles should be comparable to one another
#
# The test is run twice, once using multi-threading and once single-threaded
