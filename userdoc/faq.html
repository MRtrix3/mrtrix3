<h3><a name='acquisition'>What data do I need to perform constrained spherical deconvolution?</a></h3>
<p>
The input data for CSD is a high angular resolution diffusion-weighted imaging (HARDI) data set. 
There are three main aspects of the acquisition that impact on the quality of the CSD results.
In general, there will be trade-offs between the parameters concerned, meaning that there is no simple answer to this question.
However, we do provide our own recommendations as part of this discussion.
</p>
<dl>
  <dt><i>b</i>-value:</dt>
  <dd>higher <i>b</i>-values produce stronger angular contrast in the DW signal, 
  providing improved discrimination between the different fibre orientations.
  Note that although the raw DW images will look much noisier at higher <i>b</i>-values, 
  it is the vastly improved <em>constrast to noise</em> ratio in the angular domain that is critical for CSD.<br> 
  We would recommend a <i>b</i>-value of approximately 3000s/mm&sup2;.</dd>
  <dt>number of DW directions:</dt>
  <dd>a larger number of DW directions will produce a better characterisation of the DW signal.
  In addition to an overall increase in SNR, it provides a more precise definition of the features of the DW signal in the angular domain, 
  which is critical for CSD. In addition, since the DW signal increases in angular constrast with higher <i>b</i>-values, 
  a larger number of DW directions becomes even more important then. 
  Please note that in the context of this discussion, it is the number of <em>unique</em> directions that is important: 
  a 3 &times; 12 directions acquisition still only contains 12 directions (although with improved SNR).<br>
  We would recommend a minimum of 60 DW directions.</dd>
  <dt>SNR:</dt>
  <dd>higher SNR obviously produces better results. 
  Larger voxels will provide higher SNR, but at the expense of spatial localisation. 
  However, CSD will produce poor quality results if the SNR in the <i>b</i>=0 image is too low.
  We would recommend adjusting the voxel size until the SNR exceeds 20. 
  This should not require a huge sacrifice in terms of imaging resolution:
  for example, using 2.5mm rather than 2mm isotropic voxels effectively doubles the SNR, 
  at the expense of a relatively small reduction in spatial resolution.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
In the same way, there is also no simple answer to what the minimum requirements are.
It is possible to get reasonable-looking results using <i>b</i>=1000s/mm&sup2; and 30 DW directions, 
but the quality may then be questionable.
In general, we would urge you to follow the recommendations given here if you intend to use CSD.
</p>

<p class=sep><a href="#top">top</a></p>

<h3><a name='super'>How do I perform the super-resolved version of CSD?</a></h3>
<p>
Super-CSD is actually performed in the same way as 'normal' CSD, 
but using a higher harmonic order (lmax) than would otherwise be possible given the data.
For example, 60 directions provides enough data to perform a spherical harmonic fit up to harmonic order 8 
(which requires 45 parameters), but not enough for harmonic order 10 (which requires 66 parameters) 
&ndash; see the table in the <a href='tractography/preprocess.html#response'>response function coefficient</a> section.
This means that a 60 direction data set will be analysed using straight CSD if 
<kbd><a href='commands/csdeconv.html'>csdeconv</a></kbd> is performed with lmax=8 or lower, 
and super-resolved CSD if <kbd><a href='commands/csdeconv.html'>csdeconv</a></kbd> is performed with lmax=10 or higher.
</p>

<p class=sep><a href="#top">top</a></p>

<h3><a name='converge'>I keep getting 'failed to converge' messages with csdeconv</a></h3>
<p>
<kbd><a href='commands/csdeconv.html'>csdeconv</a></kbd> will produce one such message per voxel
where the CSD fails to converge. It is not unusual to get a dozen or so such messages per data set 
when performing a super-resolved reconstruction (see above). 
The voxels affected are typically not in white matter, so these failures usually won't affect any 
subsequent tractography. 
</p>
<p>
However, if you are getting a lot of these messages, you may need to check that the CSD images are suitable.
They can be loaded directly into <a href='general/mrview.html'>MRview</a>: the voxels that failed to converge will appear black.
If these messages do signal a real problem, you should try to perform the CSD using a lower value of lmax.
In particular, you will usually not get any such messages when performing non-super-resolved CSD (see above).
</p>

<p class=sep><a href="#top">top</a></p>

<h3><a name='coreg'>I want to coregister my anatomical images with the DWI/tracks</a></h3>
<p>
MRtrix now includes support for the <a href='general/formats.html#NIfTI'>NIfTI</a> image format, allowing straightforward interaction with 
<a href='http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/'>SPM</a> and <a href='http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/'>FSL</a> (amongst others). 
Both of these packages provide robust functionality for coregistration. 
Some simple instructions for coregistration using these packages are given below.
<p>
</p>
An important point to bear in mind is that the orientation of the DWI data and any images derived from them (including the CSD results)
should not be modified, since this may affect the orientation of the DW gradients with respect to the data, 
and hence also affect the orientation of the fibres relative to the data, 
which would obviously invalidate any subsequent tractography results.
In practice, this means that the anatomical images should be coregistered to the DWI data, 
leaving the DWI data unmodified.
</p>
<p>
The first step in the coregistration procedure is to convert the images of interest to <a href='general/formats.html#NIfTI'>NIfTI</a> format. 
The FA map appears to provide adequate contrast for coregistration with the anatomical images, so we will convert these data:
</p>
<pre>
&gt; <b><a href='commands/mrconvert.html'>mrconvert</a> anat.mif anat_coreg.nii</b>
<a href='commands/mrconvert.html'>mrconvert</a>: copying data... 100%
&gt; <b><a href='commands/mrconvert.html'>mrconvert</a> fa.mif fa_coreg.nii</b>
<a href='commands/mrconvert.html'>mrconvert</a>: copying data... 100%
</pre>
<p>
The subsequent steps depend on the software package to be used.
</p>
<h4>SPM</h4>
<p>
The procedure with <a href='http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/'>SPM</a> is straightforward: 
set the FA map as the reference image, the anatomical as the source image, 
and coregister (estimate only) with the normalised mutual information cost function. 
Once the processing is done, the <kbd>anat_coreg.nii</kbd> image will have been re-oriented 
to match that of the FA map (only the header's orientation field will have been modified).
The <kbd>anat_coreg.nii</kbd> can then be loaded into <a href='general/mrview.html'>MRview</a> instead of the original <kbd>anat.mif</kbd>.
<p>
<ul>
  <li>open SPM, and click on 'coregister' in the <em>spatial pre-processing</em> box</li>
  <li>select <em>New "Coreg: Estimate"</em></li>
  <li>double-click on <em>+Coreg: Estimate &lt;- X</em> to expand the parameter list</li>
  <li>click on <em>Reference Image &lt;- X</em> to highlight it</li>
  <li>click on <em>Specify Files</em> to open the file dialog</li>
  <li>select the <kbd>fa_coreg.nii</kbd> file and press <em>Done</em></li>
  <li>click on <em>Source Image &lt;- X</em> to highlight it</li>
  <li>click on <em>Specify Files</em> to open the file dialog</li>
  <li>select the <kbd>anat_coreg.nii</kbd> file and press <em>Done</em></li> 
  <li>double-click on <em>+Estimation options</em> to expand the list</li>
  <li>click on <em>Objective Function</em> to select it</li> 
  <li>make sure it is set to <em>Normalised Mutual Information</em></li> 
  <li>press <em>Run</em> to start the coregistration</li> 
</ul>
<p>
<kbd>anat_coreg.nii</kbd> should now be coregistered with the DWI data and any tracks generated from them.
</p>

<h4>FSL</h4>
<p>
The procedure to use with <a href='http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/'>FSL</a> is slightly more complex.
The <a href='http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/flirt/'>FLIRT</a> command does not produce good results
if the FA map is specified as the reference. The steps required are therefore to coregister the
anatomical images to the FA map, producing a 4&times;4 affine transform matrix.
As with <a href='http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/'>SPM</a>, the normalised mutual information cost function produces the best results.
The inverse of this transform can then be applied to the anatomical images 
using the <a href='commands/mrtransform.html'>mrtransform</a> command included as part of MRtrix.
<pre>
&gt; <b><a href='http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/flirt/overview.html'>flirt</a> -ref anat_coreg.nii -in fa_coreg.nii -cost normmi -searchcost normmi -dof 6 -omat transform.txt</b>
&gt; <b><a href='commands/mrtransform.html'>mrtransform</a> anat_coreg.nii -transform transform.txt -reference fa_coreg.nii -inverse -flipx anat_coreg.mif</b>
mrtransform: copying image data... 100%
</pre>
<p>
<kbd>anat_coreg.mif</kbd> should now be coregistered with the DWI data and any tracks generated from them.
</p>

<p class=sep><a href="#top">top</a></p>

<h3><a name='probmap'>How do I produce an image of the track count through each voxel?</a></h3>
<p>
The <a href='commands/tracks2prob.html'>tracks2prob</a> command can be used to generate an image 
where each voxel contains the number of tracks that pass through that voxel.
For example:
</p>
<pre>
&gt; <b><a href='commands/tracks2prob.html'>tracks2prob</a> tracks.tck -template anat.mif track_image.mif</b>
tracks2prob: generating track count image...  - ok
</pre>
<p>
This will produce an image of the number of tracks through each voxel based on the <kbd>anat.mif</kbd> template image.
</p>


<p class=sep><a href="#top">top</a></p>

<h3><a name='temp'>What are these 'mrtrix-azdj28.mif' files that keep appearing in my folder?</a></h3>
<p>
MRtrix will produce temporary files when <a href='general/cmdline.html#pipes'>data pipes</a> are used.
If one of the programs in the pipeline crashes, these files will not be deleted (see <a href='general/cmdline.html#pipes'>here</a> for details).
If you find one or more of these files amongst your data, you can safely delete them &ndash; 
assuming of course that there are no currently running MRtrix programs that may be accessing the file!
</p>

<p class=sep><a href="#top">top</a></p>

<h3><a name='analyse'>Why am I getting strange alignment issues with my Analyse format data?</a></h3>
<p>
If you use the Analyse image format to store your data, you may find that your
FOD orientations or tractography results are not correctly aligned with the
image. This is due to a limitation of the Analyse image format: it is not
capable of storing the image transformation matrix. If the data were acquired
in a non-axial orientation, and the DW gradient orientations were not
reoriented to match the image axes, this will cause an orientation mismatch.
This problem can also occur if the processing is performed in a different
format that does support storing of the transform (e.g. MRtrix or NIfTI), and
the results subsequently converted to Analyse format. 
</p>
<p>
Another issue with the Analyse image format is the lack of a clear convention
for left-right ordering. In particular, certain versions of SPM used the
convention that the data were stored left to right, which is the opposite of
the official Analyse application. In other versions of SPM, the convention to
use for this ordering can be set by editing a configuration file. An image
generated using one convention will be flipped if read assuming the opposite
convention.  Consequently, it is impossible to guarantee that images stored in
Analyse format are correctly oriented.
</p>
<p>
For these reasons, the use of Analyse images is <b>strongly discouraged</b>.
</p>


<p class=sep><a href="#top">top</a></p>

<h3><a name='FSLencoding'>Can I use the same gradient direction tables with MRtrix as I use with FSL?</a></h3>
<p>
In general, no. With MRtrix, the gradient directions need to be specified with
respect to real (scanner) coordinates. This is different from FSL, which
expects the gradient directions to be specified with respect to the image axes.
Therefore, if there is any difference between these two coordinate systems, the
gradient directions will be wrong, and so will the orientations inferred by
<a href='commands/dwi2tensor.html'>dwi2tensor</a> and 
<a href='commands/csdeconv.html'>csdeconv</a>. 
<p>
The only exception to this rule is when the images were acquired in a pure
axial orientation: in this case the two coordinate systems will be equivalent.
You can check this using <a href='commands/mrinfo.html'>mrinfo</a>, by looking
at the 'transform' entry.  For example:
<pre>
&gt; <b><a href='commands/mrinfo.html'>mrinfo</a> dwi.mif</b>
************************************************

                                <b>0           1          -0</b>      -106.6
                               <b>-0          -0           1</b>      -7.898
                                0           0           0           1
</pre>
The 3&times;3 top-left part of the transform matrix (highlighted in bold)
specifies the rotation component of the transform. If this part is the identity
(as it is above), then the acquisition is pure axial, and FSL gradient tables
can be used with MRtrix.

<p class=sep><a href="#top">top</a></p>

<h3><a name='NIFTI_and_FSL'>Why do are my MRtrix-generated NIfTI images displayed in a different orientation to my original images in FSLview?</a></h3>
<p>
When accessing any image, MRtrix will always ensure that the image axes
correspond as closely as possible with the <a
href="general/overview.html#axes">MRtrix convention</a>. To do this, it will
often be necessary to modify the transformation matrix and the associated data
layout. When writing out NIfTI format images, MRtrix always uses this new
transformation matrix, and writes out the data in a near-axial orientation. For
example, images acquired in the sagittal plane and converted to NIfTI using <a
href="http://lcni.uoregon.edu/~jolinda/MRIConvert/">mriconvert</a> are
typically written out as a stack of sagittal slices, with the transformation
matrix containing the appropriate rotation. When converted using MRtrix, the
voxels for the same image will be written out as a stack of axial slices, along
with the corresponding (but different) transformation matrix. FSLview always
displays images assuming they are stored as a stack of axial slices, but will
label the axes according to the transformation matrix. This causes problems
when displaying images processed with MRtrix alongside otherwise equivalent
images, since their data layouts are now different. Note that these will be
displayed correctly in MRView, and interpreted correctly in any MRtrix
application.
</p>
<p>
The simplest way to get around this is to also convert your original NIfTI
images using <a href="commands/mrconvert.html">mrconvert</a>, and write them
out as NIfTI images again. While it may seem odd to convert NIfTI images to
NIfTI, simply running them through <a
href="commands/mrconvert.html">mrconvert</a> will modify the images to match.
</p>

<p class=sep><a href="#top">top</a></p>

<h3><a name='normalise_tracks'>How do I spatially normalise my tracks into template space?</a></h3>
<p>
You may want to warp tracks generated in each subject's native space into a
common template space, using warps estimated using other applications (e.g. <a
href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/">SPM</a> or <a
href="http://picsl.upenn.edu/ANTS/">ANTS</a>). 
Since normalisation packages store the warp information in their own format, it
is not sensible for MRtrix to attempt to support reading the warp information
directly. Instead, the idea is to generate a 'no-warp' image in template space,
apply the relevant normalisation command to warp it into native space, and use
the final warped image to warp the tracks into template space.  This is
achieved as follows:
</p>
<p>
First, a 'no-warp' image is created in template space, with each voxel containing its own real-space coordinates in template space:
<pre>
&gt; <b><a href=commands/gen_unit_warp.html>gen_unit_warp</a> template_image.nii nowarp-[].nii</b>
</pre>
<p>
Note the use of the square brackets to instruct the application to produce a
set of image volumes, rather than a single 4D image (see <a
href='general/cmdline.html#sequences'>here</a> for details). Also, the image
format is specified as NIfTI, since this format is supported by most
normalisation packages.
</p>
<p>
The set of images produced is then warped into each subject's native space,
using the appropriate warp field and the package originally used to estimate
it. Details on performing this step are dependent on the exact package used,
and will not be discussed further here. The most important consideration is to
ensure that the target image in subject space (i.e. the image whose dimensions,
voxel size, etc. will be used as a template when creating the warped images)
covers the entire extent of all the tracks to be warped.
</p>
<p>
Once the 'no-warp' field images have been warped into subject space, each voxel
contains the coordinates of its equivalent location in template space. It is
then trivial to warp the tracks into template space.  Assuming the warped
images have been stored under the filename
<kbd>warp-0.nii</kbd>, <kbd>warp-1.nii</kbd>, <kbd>warp-2.nii</kbd>, this is
achieved as follows: 
<pre>
 &gt; <b><a href=commands/normalise_tracks.html>normalise_tracks</a> my_tracks.tck warp-[].nii my_warped_tracks.tck</b> 
</pre>
