MRtrix is now available as a package on Debian and Ubuntu systems using the <a 
href="http://neuro.debian.net/">NeuroDebian repository</a>. This provides a 
simple and effective way of installing MRtrix, along with numerous other 
related packages. For more information, refer to the instructions on the <a 
href="http://neuro.debian.net/">NeuroDebian repository</a>. Note that there is 
no guarantee that the version available on this repository is the most up to 
date.
</p>
<p>
The rest of this page provides instructions for installing MRtrix from source. 
MRtrix depends on a number of other packages.  Most, if not all of these 
packages should be available on any recent Linux distribution via the 
appropriate package manager.  MRtrix has been written and tested on Ubuntu 
Linux versions 7.10 (Gutsy) through to 10.10 (Maverick). On all these 
distributions, all dependencies are available via the Synaptic Package Manager.
</p>

<p>
On Ubuntu systems (and most likely Debian too), the following instructions 
should work with no modifications:
<h3>First-time installations: installing dependencies</h3>
The first time you install MRtrix, you will need to also install a number of
required packages. The following step installs these dependencies on Ubuntu
systems - for other distributions, you'll need to use the equivalent commands
as appropriate (see below).  You will only need to perform this step the first
time you install MRtrix:
<pre>
$ sudo apt-get install g++ python libglib2.0-dev libgtk2.0-dev libglibmm-2.4-dev libgtkmm-2.4-dev libgtkglext1-dev libgsl0-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev
</pre>
<h3>Installing MRtrix</h3>
Once the dependencies have been installed, the following steps will need to be
performed for every install or update of MRtrix:
<pre>
$ tar xfj mrtrix-0.2.X.tar.bz2
$ cd mrtrix-0.2.X
$ ./build
$ sudo ./build install
</pre>
<p>
On other distributions, different steps may be required to install the required 
dependencies, and/or to install the compiled executables. These steps are 
outlined in detail below.


<h2><a name='builddeps'>Required dependencies</a></h2>
<p>
Before any of the programs included in the MRtrix packages can be used, they 
need to be <em>compiled</em> (i.e. translated into machine code suitable for 
your specific computer platform).  This will generate the required 
<em>executables</em> and dynamic library. Certain packages and dependencies are 
needed for this step. A subset of these packages will also be required to run 
the executables. These packages are:
</p>
<h3>Needed for the compilation step (build):</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>g++ - the GNU C++ compiler (version &gt; 4.0.0 recommended)</dt>
  <dd>available from <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">http://gcc.gnu.org/</a></dd>
  <dt>python (version &gt; 2.5 recommended)</dt>
  <dd>available from <a href="http://www.python.org/">http://www.python.org/</a></dd>
  <dt>development packages for the run-time dependencies</dt>
  <dd>as listed below</dd>
</dl>
On Ubuntu, these packages can be installed using the Synaptic Package Manager, 
and can be found under the names 'g++' and 'python'.

<h3>Also needed at run-time:</h3>
The developement version of these packages is required for the compilation 
step, while the run-time versions are needed at run-time:
<dl>
  <dt>glib (version &gt; 2.16)</dt>
  <dt>gtk+ (version &gt; 2.12)</dt>
  <dd>both available from <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">http://www.gtk.org/</a></dd>
  <dt>glibmm (version &gt; 2.16)</dt>
  <dt>gtkmm (version &gt; 2.12)</dt>
  <dd>both available from <a href="http://www.gtkmm.org/">http://www.gtkmm.org/</a></dd>
  <dt>gtkglext (version &gt; 1.0)</dt>
  <dd>available from <a href="http://www.k-3d.org/gtkglext/Main_Page">http://www.k-3d.org/gtkglext/Main_Page</a></dd>
  <dt>GSL (GNU Scientific Library; version &gt; 1.8)</dt>
  <dd>available from <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/">http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/</a></dd>
  <dt>a working OpenGL implementation (version &gt; 1.2)</dt>
  <dd>for best results on Linux, we recommend the use of an nVidia&reg; graphics card together with the nVidia&reg; proprietory drivers. 
  These drivers may be available via the distribution package manager (this is the case with Ubuntu Linux). 
  If not, they can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/">http://www.nvidia.com/</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>
On Ubuntu, these packages can be installed using the Synaptic Package Manager, 
and can be found under the names 'libglib2.0-dev', 'libgtk2.0-dev',
'libglibmm-2.4-dev', 'libgtkmm-2.4-dev', 'libgtkglext1-dev', 'libgsl0-dev',
  'libgl1-mesa-dev' (for a generic OpenGL implementation - the nVidia&reg; 
driver already includes the required development files), and
  'libglu1-mesa-dev'.



<p class=sep><a href="#top">top</a></p>

<h2><a name='compile'>The compilation step</a></h2>
<p>
Once all dependencies are installed, MRtrix can be compiled by issuing the 
commands (modify as appropriate):
</p>
<pre>
$ <b>tar xjf mrtrix-0.2.X.tar.bz2</b>
$ <b>cd mrtrix-0.2.X/</b>
$ <b>./build</b>
</pre>
<p>
If this completes with no errors, all executables should be located in the <kbd>bin/</kbd> folder, 
and the <kbd>libmrtrix-0_2_X.so</kbd> dynamic library should be located in the <kbd>lib/</kbd> folder.
</p>
<p>
If any errors do occur, you may need to modify the configuration file.
The relevant file will be located in the <kbd>sysconf/</kbd> folder,
will have a <kbd>*.py</kbd> suffix, and will be named according to the target platform.
Unfortunately a full discussion of the various options that can be modified is beyond the scope of this document.
</p>

<p class=sep><a href="#top">top</a></p>

<h2><a name='install'>Installation of executables</a></h2>
<p>
Once all executables and the dynamic library have been successfully created, 
they can be made available for use.  The recommended installation procedure is 
as follows (note that this can be tailored to your needs).  The following 
commands will typically need to be issued from the <em>root</em> account.  If 
you do not have root or administrative access to your system, you can simply 
install the files to a location that you have write permissions for (i.e.  
anywhere in your home folder), in which case the following commands can be 
issued from your own account.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> on Ubuntu and other systems without a <em>root</em> account, 
simply type <kbd>sudo</kbd> as the first word on the command line 
(see <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo">this page</a> for details).
</p>

<p>
The simplest way to perform this step is to use the special <kbd>install</kbd> 
target (as root if the destination is not user-writable):
<pre>
# <b>./build install</b>
</pre>
By default, this will copy the executables and dynamic library to the folder 
<kbd>/opt/mrtrix</kbd>. To ensure these are in the system path, it will also
create symbolic links to them in the folders <kbd>/usr/bin</kbd> (for the
executables) and <kbd>/usr/lib</kbd> (for the dynamic library). Finally , it
will also create a default system-wide configuration file in
<kbd>/etc/mrtrix.conf</kbd>, to enable multi-threading on all cores as detected
by the build script.
</p>
<p>
If the files need to be installed to a different folder,
a different prefix can be specified as an additional parameter:
<pre>
# <b>./build install=/usr/local</b>
</pre>
<p>
When installing to a location that is not in the path (such as the 
<kbd>/opt</kbd> folder), the simplest way to make the executables available is 
to create symbolic links to the executables in a standard location such as 
<kbd>/usr/bin</kbd> or <kbd>/usr/local/bin</kbd>.  By default, the install step 
will create symbolic links in the <kbd>/usr/bin</kbd> and <kbd>/usr/lib</kbd> 
for the executables and dynamic library respectively.  This can be disabled by 
specifying an empty path to the linkto special target:
<pre>
# <b>./build install linkto=</b>
</pre>
A different location can also be specified by passing a suitable prefix as an 
additional parameter. For example:
<pre>
# <b>./build install=/usr/local/mrtrix linkto=/usr/local</b>
</pre>
will copy the executables and dynamic library in 
<kbd>/usr/local/mrtrix/bin</kbd> and <kbd>/usr/local/mrtrix/lib</kbd> 
respectively, and then create symbolic links to these in the corresponding 
<kbd>/usr/local/bin</kbd> and <kbd>/usr/local/lib</kbd> folders.


<h3>If the executables are not in the path:</h3>
<p>
In some cases, it may not be possible to install the executables (or symbolic 
links to them) into a location that is in the default path. This can happen for 
instance if installing into a user account. In these case, the location of the 
executables needs to be added to the PATH environment variable, and the 
location of the dynamic library needs to be added to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
environment variable (alternatively, it may also be possible to add the latter 
to the dynamic loader's search path, although this is system-specific).
<p>
This can typically be done by adding a couple of lines to the relevant startup 
script.  Unfortunately, each Unix variant may use a different procedure for 
this. For single user accounrs, it should be sufficient to add these lines to 
the <kbd>~/.bashrc</kbd> file:
<pre>
PATH=/home/user/mrtrix/bin:$PATH
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/user/mrtrix/lib
</pre>
For C shell users (csh or tcsh), the following lines should be added to the 
<kbd>~/.cshrc</kbd>:
<pre>
setenv PATH /opt/mrtrix/bin:$PATH
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /opt/mrtrix/lib/
</pre>

<p class=sep><a href="#top">top</a></p>


<h2><a name='config'>Final configuration</a></h2>
<p>
Once the software is up and running, is it worth taking the time to perform a few simple configurations steps.
The following important application behaviours can be modified by setting the relevant variables 
in the <a href='../appendix/config.html'>configuration file</a> (described in more detail
in the <a href='../appendix/config.html'>Appendix</a>).
Note that if the configuration file does not exist, or if the variables are not set, 
default values will be used instead.
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Enable multi-threading</dt>
  <dd>If MRtrix is installed on a multi-processor or multi-core system, some of the more CPU intensive
  tasks can take advantage of this by performing the processing in parallel across some or all of the CPU cores.
  Currently, the <a href='../tractography/preprocess.html#csd'>CSD computation</a> and
  <a href='../tractography/tracking.html'>tractography</a> programs are both ready 
  for multi-threading, and will therefore take substantially less time if multi-threading is enabled.
  This is done by adding the following line to your <a href='../appendix/config.html'>configuration file</a>:
  <pre>NumberOfThreads: 4</pre> with the number set appropriately for your
  system. Note that a default configuration file with this parameter already
  set to the appropriate value should already exist if the software
  was installed using the <kbd>./build install</kbd> command (see above).</dd>

  <dt>Left-right convention for Analyse images</dt>
  <dd>There is some ambiguity in the Analyse format as to whether images are stored in left to right order
  or in the reverse order. This can lead to a great deal of confusion, and for this reason, it is not recommended 
  to use the Analyse format if it can be avoided. For those cases when you need to use this format, 
  the left-right ordering convention can be set by adding this line to your <a href='../appendix/config.html'>configuration file</a>:
  <pre>Analyse.LeftToRight: false</pre>
  By default, Analyse images are assumed to be stored left to right.</dd>
