# Script that generates a five-tissue-type (5TT) segmented image: the format appropriate for ACT
#
# In this script, major stages of processing can be performed in one of two ways:
#   - Using FSL tools: BET for brain extraction, FAST for tissue segmentation, FIRST for sub-cortical grey matter segmentation
#   - Using segmentations from FreeSurfer
# Alternative algorithms for performing this conversion can be added by creating a new file in lib/mrtrix3/_5ttgen/ and
#   defining the appropriate functions; 5ttgen will automatically make that algorithm available at the command-line
