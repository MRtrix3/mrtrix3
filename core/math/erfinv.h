     * While the erfinv() function is exposed in the API, it will
     * encounter floating-point precision issues if provided with
     * input values greater than approx. +0.999999 or smaller than
     * approx. -0.999999. If such extreme values are likely to arise
     * during processing, it is highly recommended that programmers
     * instead operate natively on the values q = 1.0 - p and/or
     * qc = 1.0 + p, and pass the appropriate value (q or qc) directly
     * to the erfcinv() function. This will ensure full use of
     * available floating-point precision within these functions,
     * which is otherwise lost if performing one of the above conversions
     * (either implicitly within one of these functions, or explicitly
     * by the programmer prior to invoking erfinv()).
