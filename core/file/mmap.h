         * the file will be accessed with read-write permissions, but the
         * mechanism used depends on whether the file is detected as residing
         * on a local or a networked filesystem, and whether the filesystem is
         * mounted with synchronous IO. If the filesystem is \e local and
         * \e asynchronous, the file is memory-mapped as-is with read-write
         * permissions. Otherwise, a write-back RAM buffer is allocated to
         * store the contents of the file, and written back when the
         * constructor is invoked. 
         *
         * By default, if the file is mapped using the delayed write-back
         * mechanism, its contents will be preloaded into the RAM buffer. If
         * the file has just been created, \a preload should be set to \c false to
         * prevent this, in which case the contents will set to zero.
         *
         * By default, the whole file is mapped. If \a mapped_size is
         * non-zero, then only the region of size \a mapped_size starting from
         * the byte offset specified in \a entry will be mapped.
