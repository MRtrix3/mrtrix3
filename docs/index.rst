Welcome to the MRtrix user documentation!
==================================

MRtrix provides a set of tools to perform diffusion-weighted MRI white matter tractography in the presence of crossing fibres, using Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (`Tournier et al.. 2004`_; `Tournier et al. 2007`_), and a probabilisitic streamlines algorithm (`Tournier et al., 2012`_). These applications have been written from scratch in C++, using the functionality provided by the `GNU Scientific Library`_, and `Qt`_. The software is currently capable of handling DICOM, NIfTI and AnalyseAVW image formats, amongst others. The source code is distributed under the `GNU General Public License`_.
