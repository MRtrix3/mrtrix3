To view the results load the population FOD template image in :ref:`mrview`,
and overlay the fixel images using the vector plot tool. Note that *p*-value
images are saved as (1 - *p*-value). Therefore to visualise all results at a
threshold of *p* < 0.05, within the :ref:`mrview` fixel plot tool, apply a
*lower* threshold at a value of 0.95.
