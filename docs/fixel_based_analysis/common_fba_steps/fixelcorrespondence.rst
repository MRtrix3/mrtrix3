Before, we obtained spatial correspondence between subject and template. Next, we corrected the fixel orientations to ensure angular correspondence of the segmented peaks of subject and template. Here, for each fixel in the template fixel analysis mask, we identify the corresponding fixel in each voxel of the subject image and assign the FD value of the subject fixel to the corresponding fixel in template space. If no fixel exists in the subject that corresponds to the template fixel then it is assigned a value of zero. See `this paper <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26004503>`__ for more information. In the command below, you will note that the output fixel directory is the same for all subjects. This directory now stores data for all subjects at corresponding fixels, ready for input to :code:`fixelcfestats` in subsequent steps::

    foreach * : fixelcorrespondence IN/fixel_in_template_space/fd.mif ../template/fixel_mask ../template/fd PRE.mif
