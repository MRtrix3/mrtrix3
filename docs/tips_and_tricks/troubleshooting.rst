Troubleshooting
===============

As of the initial *MRtrix3* release (version ``3.0.0``), the
various "Troubleshooting" pages that once formed a section of
the software documentation are now maintained within a `distinct
Wiki category <http://community.mrtrix.org/c/wiki>`__ on the
`*MRtrix3* community forum <http://community.mrtrix.org>`__. This
will allow the developers to more quickly deploy updates to
documentation and recommendations, as well as allow users of the
software to contribute modifications or new pages themselves.

Please `visit the Wiki <http://community.mrtrix.org/c/wiki>`__ and
search for an existing solution to any issues you face, and/or
contribute to the discussion!
