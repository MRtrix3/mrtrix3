=============
MacOS X installation
=============

We outline the steps for installing *MRtrix3* on MacOS X. Please consult 
:ref:`mac_trouble_shooting` if you encounter any issues with the configure, build
or runtime operations of *MRtrix3*.

Check requirements
------------------

To install *MRtrix3* , you will need the following:

-  a `C++11 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11>`__ compliant
   compiler (e.g. `clang <http://clang.llvm.org/>`__ in Xcode)
-  `Python <https://www.python.org/>`__ version >= 2.6 (already included in MacOS X)
-  The `zlib <http://www.zlib.net/>`__ compression library (already included in MacOS X)
-  `Eigen <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/>`__ version 3.2 *(do not install the beta version)*
-  `Qt <http://www.qt.io/>`__ version >= 5.1 *[GUI components only]* -
   important: versions prior to this will *not* work

.. WARNING:: 
    To run the GUI components of *MRtrix3*  (``mrview`` & ``shview``), you will also need:

    -  an `OpenGL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL>`__ 3.3 compliant graphics card and corresponding software driver - thankfully OpenGL 3.3 is supported across the entire MacOS X range with OS versions >= 10.9.

Install Dependencies
--------------------

1. Update MacOS X to version 10.10 (Yosemite) or higher - OpenGL 3.3 will
   typically not work on older versions

2. Install XCode from the Apple Store

3. Install Eigen3 and Qt5. 

   There are several alternatives to do this, depending on your current system setup. 
   The most convenient is probably to use your favorite package manager (`Homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`__ or 
   `MacPorts <http://macports.org/>`__), or install one of these if you haven't already. 
   
   If you find your first attempt doesn't work, please resist the temptation to try one of the other options: 
   in our experience, this only leads to further conflicts, which won't help installing MRtrix3 *and* will make things 
   more difficult to fix later. Once you pick one of these options, we strongly recommend you stick with it, and 
   consult the `community forum <http://community.mrtrix.org>`__ if needed for advice and troubleshooting. 
   
   - With `Homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`__:
       - Install Eigen3: ``brew install eigen``
       - Install Qt5: ``brew install qt5``
       - Add Qt's binaries to your path: ``export PATH=`brew --prefix`/opt/qt5/bin:$PATH``
      
   - With `MacPorts <http://macports.org/>`__:
       - Install Eigen3: ``port install eigen3``
       - Install Qt5: ``port install qt5``
       - Install pkg-config: ``port install pkgconfig``
       - Add Qt's binaries to your path: ``export PATH=/opt/local/libexec/qt5/bin:$PATH`` 
   
   - As a last resort, you can manually install Eigen3 and Qt5:
     You can use this procedure if you have good reasons to avoid the other options, or if for some reason 
     you cannot get either `Homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`__ or `MacPorts <http://macports.org/>`__ to work.
       - Install Eigen3: download and extract the source code from `eigen.tuxfamily.org <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/>`__ 
           Note that *MRtrix3* does not yet fully support the Eigen 3.3 beta,
           and installation of this version may result in runtime issues. If
           performing a manual installation, download the latest stable release
           of Eigen3.
       - Install Qt5: download and install the latest version from `<http://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/>`__ 
           You need to select the file labelled ``qt-opensource-mac-x64-clang-5.X.X.dmg``.
           Note that you need to use at least Qt 5.1, since earlier versions
           don't support OpenGL 3.3. We advise you to use the latest version
           (5.5.0 as of the last update). You can choose to install it
           system-wide or just in your home folder, whichever suits - just
           remember where you installed it. 
       - Make sure Qt5 tools are in your PATH
           (edit as appropriate) ``export PATH=/path/to/Qt5/5.X.X/clang_64/bin:$PATH``
       - Set the CFLAG variable for eigen
           (edit as appropriate) ``export EIGEN_CFLAGS="-isystem /where/you/extracted/eigen"``
           Make sure *not* to include the final ``/Eigen`` folder in the path name - use the folder in which it resides instead!

Git setup
---------

Set up your git environment as per the `Git instructions
page <https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/#setting-up-git>`__

Build *MRtrix3* 
-------------

1. Clone the *MRtrix3*  repository:

   ::

       git clone https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrtrix3.git

   or if you have set up your SSH keys (for collaborators):

   ::

       git clone git@github.com:MRtrix3/mrtrix3.git


2. Configure the *MRtrix3* install:

   ::

       cd mrtrix3
       ./configure

   If this does not work, examine the 'configure.log' file that is
   generated by this step, it may give clues as to what went wrong.

3. Build the binaries:

   ::

       ./build

Set up *MRtrix3* 
--------------

1. Set your PATH in the shell startup file:

   ::

       echo "export PATH=$(pwd)/release/bin:$(pwd)/scripts:\$PATH" >> ~/.bash_profile

2. Close the terminal and start another one to ensure the startup file
   is read (or just type 'bash')

3. type ``mrview`` to check that everything works

4. You may also want to have a look through the `configuration file options <config_file_options>`_ and set anything you think might be required on your system.

  .. NOTE:: 
    The above assumes that your shell will read the `~/.profile` file at startup time. This is not always guaranteed, depending on how your system is configured. If you find that the above doesn' work (e.g. typing `mrview` returns a 'command not found' error), try writing the updated PATH to a different file, for example `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bashrc`. In other words, amend the command in step 1 to end with `... >> ~/.bash_profile`, and see whether this allows `mrview` to run from a fresh terminal. 


Keeping *MRtrix3*  up to date
--------------------------

1. You can update your installation at any time by opening a Git Bash
   terminal in the *MRtrix3*  folder, and typing:

   ::

       git pull
       ./build

2. If this doesn't work immediately, it may be that you need to re-run
   the configure script:

   ::

       ./configure

   and re-run step 1 again.
