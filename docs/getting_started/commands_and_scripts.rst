Commands and scripts
====================

The MRtrix3 software package includes a suite of tools for image analysis and visualisation. With the exception of :ref:`mrview` and :ref:`shview`, all MRtrix executables are designed to be run via a terminal using a consistent :ref:`command-line interface <command-line-interface>`. While many of the tools and features are discussed within tutorials found in this documentation, a comprehensive :ref:`list-of-mrtrix3-commands` and :ref:`list-of-mrtrix3-scripts` can be found in the reference section. This list provides links to the help page (manual) for each executable, which can also be accessed by typing the :code:`-help` option after any executable on the terminal.
