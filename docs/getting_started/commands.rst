The *MRtrix3* software package includes a suite of tools for image analysis and visualisation. With the exception of :ref:`mrview` and :ref:`shview`, all *MRtrix3* executables are designed to be run via a terminal using a consistent :ref:`command-line interface <command-line-interface>`. While many of the tools and features are discussed within tutorials found in this documentation, a comprehensive :ref:`list-of-mrtrix3-commands` can be found in the reference section. These lists provide links to the help page (manual) for each executable, which can also be accessed by typing the :code:`-help` option after the executable name on the terminal.
