.. _dwi_masking:

DWI masking
===========

Many DWI processing operations either necessitate the use of a binary mask
image in order to spatially constrain the operation in some way, or can be
executed in less time by not performing the relevant calculations in those
voxels that are not of interest. However, while this would seem like a
relatively trivial operation, it is in fact deceptively difficult to
devise an appropriate heuristic for deriving an appropriate mask that works
for a wide range of DWI data. It is not uncommon for the derivation of this
mask to go awry in a range of scenarios, which can have serious implications
for downstream processing steps. For this reason, as of MRtrix version
`3.1.0`, a *range* of DWI mask derivation algorithms are provided, allowing
users to assess which heuristics work best for their particular data. The
purpose of this documentation page is to describe those algorithms that are
available, the circumstances in which they may or may not work, the features
that are available for users to manipulate this behaviour, and the
applications in which these details are most relevant for user attention.

``dwi2mask`` algorithms
-----------------------

``dwi2mask 3dautomask``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Provides the mean *b=0* image directly to AFNI_ `command
``3dAutomask`` <https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/3dAutomask.html>`_ .

``dwi2mask ants``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Provides the mean *b=0* image directly to ANTs_ command
``antsBrainExtraction.sh``, configured for T2-weighted image input.

This algorithm necessitates the specification of a template image and
corresponding binary mask image defined on that template. These two images
must be provided by the user either using the ``-template`` command-line
option, or the ``Dwi2maskTemplateImage`` and ``Dwi2maskTemplateMask``
configuration file options (see :ref:`dwi2mask_config`).

``dwi2mask b02template``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Registers the subject's mean *b=0* image to a template image, and
back-propagates a binary mask back into the individual's DWI voxel grid.
Achieved as follows:

1. Non-linearly register subject's mean *b=0* image to a specified template
   image;

2. *(If not calculated implicitly as part of step 1)* Invert the non-linear
   deformation field;

3. Transform binary mask associated with template image onto voxel grid of
   mean *b=0* image (with interpolation);

4. Apply a threshold of 0.5 to transformed image to produce a mask.

There are multiple external software tools that can be utilised for performing
the core image registration and transformation processes:

-  ``antsquick``: Utilises the ANTs_ command ``antsRegistrationSyNQuick.sh``
   for registration; transforms mask image to subject space using ANTs_
   command ``antsApplyTransforms``.

-  ``antsquick``: Utilises the ANTs_ commands ``antsRegistration``
   for registration, using the registration parameters specified in the article:

   Tustison, Nicholas J., and Brian B. Avants.
   Explicit B-Spline Regularization in Diffeomorphic Image Registration.
   Frontiers in Neuroinformatics 7 (December 23, 2013): 39.
   https://doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2013.00039.

   Template mask image is then transformed to subject space using ANTs_
   command ``antsApplyTransforms``.

-  ``fsl``: Utilises FSL_ commands as follows:

   - ``flirt_``: Initial affine registration;
   - ``fnirt_``: Non-linear registration;
   - ``invwarp_``: Inversion of warp from subject to template;
   - ``applywarp_``: Transform template mask to subject space.

By default, if no manual selection is made here using either the ``-software``
command-line option or the ``Dwi2maskTemplateSoftware`` configuration file
entry, the ``antsquick`` approach will be used.

This algorithm necessitates the specification of a template image and
corresponding binary mask image defined on that template. These two images
must be provided by the user either using the ``-template`` command-line
option, or the ``Dwi2maskTemplateImage`` and ``Dwi2maskTemplateMask``
configuration file options (see :ref:`dwi2mask_config`).

The registration operation can be expected to perform best if the specified
template image is of comparable shape and image contrast to that of the
*b=0* volumes of the DWI data being processed. As such, if using an existing
template image, a T2-weighted image would be recommended. Alternatively, one
could produce a population template *b=0* image based on one's own data, and
manually define a mask on that template that could then subsequently be
used for DWI masking.

For all registration algorithms, there are ``dwi2mask`` command-line options
available for fine-tuning the behaviour of the registration by passing
command-line options down to the relevant command(s); further, it is possible
to set such parameters within the MRtrix configuration file, which may be of
particular use if configuration file option ``Dwi2maskAlgorithm`` is set to
``b02template`` (see :ref:`dwi2mask_config`).

``dwi2mask consensus``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This algorithm is unique compared to all other ``dwi2mask`` algorithms,
in that it does not provide one specific heuristic for DWI mask estimation;
instead, it executes *all other* ``dwi2mask`` algorithms, and produces a
single mask based on the consensus of those algorithms. Currently this
consensus is simply those voxels that were included in the estimated masks
of *more than 50%* of the algorithms utilised. Note that if the external
software requirements of any specific ``dwi2mask`` algorithm are not
installed, the ``consensus`` algorithm will report that not all algorithms
could be executed, and will utilise only the outputs of those algorithms
that *could* be executed successfully.

``dwi2mask fslbet``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Provides the mean *b=0* image directly to FSL_ command ``bet``.

``dwi2mask hdbet``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Provides the mean *b=0* image directly to HD-BET_ command ``hd-bet``.

``dwi2mask legacy``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Reproduces the behaviour of the ``dwi2mask`` binary executable that was
included in *MRtrix3* prior to version ``3.1.0``.

It involves the following steps:

1. Compute the mean diffusion-weighted signal intensity for each *b*-value;

2. For each *b*-value independently, automatically determine a threshold to
   apply to produce a binary mask;

3. Sum the masks from step 2 across *b*-values;

4. Apply a median filter;

5. Select the largest connected component and fill holes;

6. Apply mask cleaning filter to remove small areas only connected to the
   largest component via thin "bridges".

``dwi2mask mean``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A heuristic algorithm that is based on simply taking the mean DWI intensity
across all volumes, and then applying a threshold. It was reported to provide
good results for some forms of data, but is not necessarily guaranteed to do
so for other DWI acquisition protocols; algorithm ``dwi2mask trace`` is
intended to operate on a similar concept, but be more robust against variations in
acquisition.

Operations are as follows:

1. Compute the mean DWI intensity across all volumes, regardless of *b*-value;

2. Automatically determine an intensity threshold for this image to produce
   a binary mask;

3. Select the largest connected component and fill any holes;

4. Apply mask cleaning filter to remove small areas only connected to the
   largest component via thin "bridges".

``dwi2mask trace``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Heuristic algorithms for generating masks from DWI data based on
trace-weighted images (i.e. mean image intensity within each shell)
in a manner different to that of the ``dwi2mask legacy`` algorithm.

Its behaviour is as follows:

1.  Calculate the trace-weighted image for each shell;

2.  For each shell, find a multiplicative factor that gives the trace-weighted
    image approximately the same intensity of that of the first shell
    (this is so that each shell contributes approximately equally
    toward determination of the mask);
   
3.  Calculate the mean trace-weighted image across shells;

4.  Automatically determine an intensity threshold for this image to produce
    a binary mask;

5.  Select the largest connected component and fill any holes;

6.  Apply mask cleaning filter to remove small areas only connected to the
    largest component via thin "bridges";

7.  If the command-line option ``-iterative`` is *not* used, the algorithm
    ceases at this point (i.e. the default behaviour);
   
8.  For each *b*-value shell, compute the mean and standard deviation of
    the trace-weighted image intensities inside and outside of the current
    mask, and use this to derive Cohen's *d* statistic;
   
9.  Perform a recombination of the trace-weighted images; but the
    multiplicative weights applied to each *b*-value shell trace image are,
    instead of being based on intensity matching as in step 2, the
    Cohen's *d* statistics calculated in step 8;
   
10. Apply a threshold and mask filtering operations as in steps 4-6;

11. If the resulting mask differs from the previous estimate, go back to
    step 8; if not, or if a maximum number of iterations is reached,
    the algorithm is completed.

Note that the iterative version of this algorithm can currently be considered
a hypothetical heuristic, and it is not yet known whether or not its behaviour
is reasonable across a range of DWI data; it should therefore be considered
entirely experimental.

.. _dwi2mask_python:

Python scripts utilising ``dwi2mask``
-------------------------------------

There are a number of Python scripts provided within *MRtrix3* that
operate on DWI data and necessitate use of a mask, and therefore (if not
provided with one explicitly at the command-line) will internally execute
the ``dwi2mask`` command.

Because it is not possible for the user to manually specify how ``dwi2mask``
should be utilised in this scenario, there are 
`configuration file options <../reference/config_file_options.html>`_
provided to assist in controlling the behaviour of ``dwi2mask`` in these
scenarios (see below).

.. _dwi2mask_config:

Configuration file options
--------------------------

There are many options that can be set within the *MRtrix3*
:ref:`mrtrix_config` that directly influence the operation of the ``dwi2mask``
command. These are included in the :ref:`config_file_options` page, but are
mentioned here also for discoverability:

-  ``Dwi2maskAlgorithm``

   For those :ref:`dwi2mask_python`, this is the ``dwi2mask`` algorithm
   that will be invoked. If not explicitly set, the ``legacy`` algorithm
   will be used.
   
   .. NOTE::
   
       Setting this configuration file option does *not* enable the
       utilisation of ``dwi2mask`` without manually specifying the
       algorithm to be used. For manual usage, the algorithm must *always*
       be specified. This option *only* controls the algorithm that will
       be used when ``dwi2mask`` is invoked from inside one of the Python 
       scripts provided with *MRtrix3*.

-  ``Dwi2maskTemplateSoftware``

   If ``dwi2mask b02template`` is invoked, and the ``-software`` command-line
   option is *not* used, the value of this option determines the software
   tool that will be utilised for registration to the template and
   back-propagation of the mask in template space to the subject's DWI
   data. Valid values are specified in :ref:`dwi2mask_b02template` above. In the
   absence of this configuration file option, ``antsquick`` (i.e. ANTs_
   ``antsRegistrationSyNQuick.sh``) will be used.

-  ``Dwi2maskTemplateImage`` and ``Dwi2maskTemplateMask``

   This pair of configuration file options allow the user to pre-specify the
   filesystem locations of the two images (T2-weighted template and 
   corresponding binary mask) to be utilised by the ``dwi2mask ants`` and
   ``dwi2mask b02template`` algorithms. Note that there is no "default" template
   to be utilised by these algorithms; so the user *must* either include these
   entries in their configuration file, or manually specify the ``-template``
   command-line  option whenever they use ``dwi2mask ants`` or
   ``dwi2mask b02template``. If the value of configuration file option
   "``Dwi2maskAlgorithm``" is "``ants``" or "``b02template``", then
   these two entries *must also* be specified.

-  ``Dwi2maskTemplateANTsQuickOptions``, ``Dwi2maskTemplateANTsFullOptions``,
   ``Dwi2maskTemplateFSLFlirtOptions`` and ``Dwi2maskTemplateFSLFnirtConfig``

   These options allow full automated control over the parameters with which
   the external neuroimaging software package registration commands are
   executed. If one of the relevant ``dwi2mask b02template`` command-line options
   is used explicitly (``-ants_options``, ``-flirt_options``, ``-fnirt_config``),
   that information takes precedence; otherwise, if one of these configuration
   file entries is set, that information will be propagated directly to the
   relevant command.
