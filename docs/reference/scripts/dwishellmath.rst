dwishellmath
============

Synopsis
--------

Apply an mrmath operation to each b-value shell in a DWI series

Usage
-----

::

    dwishellmath input operation output [ options ]

-  *input*: The input diffusion MRI series
-  *operation*: The operation to be applied to each shell; this must be one of the following: mean, median, sum, product, rms, norm, var, std, min, max, absmax, magmax
-  *output*: The output image series

Description
-----------

The output of this command is a 4D image, where each volume corresponds to a b-value shell (in order of increasing b-value), and the intensities within each volume correspond to the chosen statistic having been computed from across the DWI volumes belonging to that b-value shell.

Example usages
--------------

-   *To compute the mean diffusion-weighted signal in each b-value shell*::

        $ dwishellmath dwi.mif mean shellmeans.mif

Options
-------

Options for importing the gradient table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **-grad** Provide a gradient table in MRtrix format

- **-fslgrad bvecs bvals** Provide a gradient table in FSL bvecs/bvals format

Additional standard options for Python scripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **-nocleanup** do not delete intermediate files during script execution, and do not delete scratch directory at script completion.

- **-scratch /path/to/scratch/** manually specify the path in which to generate the scratch directory.

- **-continue <ScratchDir> <LastFile>** continue the script from a previous execution; must provide the scratch directory path, and the name of the last successfully-generated file.

Standard options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **-info** display information messages.

- **-quiet** do not display information messages or progress status. Alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.

- **-debug** display debugging messages.

- **-force** force overwrite of output files.

- **-nthreads number** use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).

- **-help** display this information page and exit.

- **-version** display version information and exit.
