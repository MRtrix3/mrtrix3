.. _responsemean:

responsemean
============

Synopsis
--------

Calculate the mean response function from a set of text files

Usage
--------

::

    responsemean inputs output [ options ]

-  *inputs*: The input response functions
-  *output*: The output mean response function

Description
-----------

Example usage: /c/Users/rob/mrtrix3/bin/responsemean input_response1.txt input_response2.txt input_response3.txt ... output_average_response.txt

All response function files provided must contain the same number of unique b-values (lines), as well as the same number of coefficients per line.

As long as the number of unique b-values is identical across all input files, the coefficients will be averaged. This is performed on the assumption that the actual acquired b-values are identical. This is however impossible for the responsemean command to determine based on the data provided; it is therefore up to the user to ensure that this requirement is satisfied.

Options
-------

Standard options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **-continue <ScratchDir> <LastFile>** Continue the script from a previous execution; must provide the scratch directory path, and the name of the last successfully-generated file

- **-force** Force overwrite of output files if pre-existing

- **-help** Display help information for the script

- **-nocleanup** Do not delete intermediate files during script, or scratch directory at script completion

- **-nthreads number** Use this number of threads in MRtrix multi-threaded applications (0 disables multi-threading)

- **-scratch /path/to/scratch/** Manually specify the path in which to generate the scratch directory

- **-quiet** Suppress all console output during script execution

- **-info** Display additional information and progress for every command invoked

- **-debug** Display additional debugging information over and above the output of -info

optional arguments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **-legacy** Use the legacy behaviour of former command 'average_response': average response function coefficients directly, without compensating for global magnitude differences between input files
