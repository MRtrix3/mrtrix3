mtbin
===================

Synopsis
--------

Multi-Tissue Bias field correction and Intensity Normalisation (MTBIN)

Usage
--------

::

    mtbin [ options ]  input output [ input output ... ]

-  *input output*: list of all input and output tissue compartment files. See example usage in the description. Note that any number of tissues can be normalised

Description
-----------

This command inputs N number of tissue components (e.g. from multi-tissue CSD), and outputs N corrected tissue components. Intensity normalisation is performed by either determining a common global normalisation factor for all tissue types (default) or by normalising each tissue type independently with a single tissue-specific global scale factor.

Example usage: mtbin wm.mif wm_norm.mif gm.mif gm_norm.mif csf.mif csf_norm.mif.

The estimated multiplicative bias field is guaranteed to have a mean of 1 over all voxels within the mask.

Options
-------

-  **-mask image** define the mask to compute the normalisation within. If not supplied this is estimated automatically

-  **-value number** specify the value to which the summed tissue compartments will be normalised to (Default: sqrt(1/(4*pi)) = 0.282094)

-  **-bias image** output the estimated bias field

-  **-independent** intensity normalise each tissue type independently

-  **-maxiter number** set the maximum number of iterations. Default(100). It will stop before the max iterations if convergence is detected

-  **-check image** check the automatically computed mask

Standard options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **-info** display information messages.

-  **-quiet** do not display information messages or progress status.

-  **-debug** display debugging messages.

-  **-force** force overwrite of output files. Caution: Using the same file as input and output might cause unexpected behaviour.

-  **-nthreads number** use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading)

-  **-failonwarn** terminate program if a warning is produced

-  **-help** display this information page and exit.

-  **-version** display version information and exit.
