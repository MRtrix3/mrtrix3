.. _responsemean:

responsemean
============

Synopsis
--------

Calculate the mean response function from a set of text files

Usage
-----

::

    responsemean inputs output [ options ]

-  *inputs*: The input response functions
-  *output*: The output mean response function

Description
-----------

Example usage: responsemean input_response1.txt input_response2.txt input_response3.txt ... output_average_response.txt

All response function files provided must contain the same number of unique b-values (lines), as well as the same number of coefficients per line.

As long as the number of unique b-values is identical across all input files, the coefficients will be averaged. This is performed on the assumption that the actual acquired b-values are identical. This is however impossible for the responsemean command to determine based on the data provided; it is therefore up to the user to ensure that this requirement is satisfied.

Options
-------

- **-legacy** Use the legacy behaviour of former command 'average_response': average response function coefficients directly, without compensating for global magnitude differences between input files

Additional standard options for Python scripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **-nocleanup** do not delete intermediate files during script execution, and do not delete scratch directory at script completion.

- **-scratch /path/to/scratch/** manually specify the path in which to generate the scratch directory.

- **-continue <ScratchDir> <LastFile>** continue the script from a previous execution; must provide the scratch directory path, and the name of the last successfully-generated file.

Standard options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **-info** display information messages.

- **-quiet** do not display information messages or progress status. Alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.

- **-debug** display debugging messages.

- **-force** force overwrite of output files.

- **-nthreads number** use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).

- **-config key value**  *(multiple uses permitted)* temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.

- **-help** display this information page and exit.

- **-version** display version information and exit.
