meshsample
===================

Synopsis
--------

Sample the values of an image the vertex locations of a surface mesh

Usage
--------

::

    meshsample [ options ]  input input output

-  *input*: the input mesh file
-  *input*: the input image
-  *output*: the output sampled values

Description
-----------

This command assumes that the surface is defined in such a way that the vertices are defined in real / scanner space. If a surface is defined with respect to some other space, it is necessary to first explicitly perform a spatial transformation of the surface data prior to running this command.

Options
-------

-  **-interp method** set the interpolation method to use when reslicing (choices: nearest, linear, cubic, sinc. Default: cubic).

Standard options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **-info** display information messages.

-  **-quiet** do not display information messages or progress status; alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.

-  **-debug** display debugging messages.

-  **-force** force overwrite of output files (caution: using the same file as input and output might cause unexpected behaviour).

-  **-nthreads number** use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).

-  **-config key value** *(multiple uses permitted)* temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.

-  **-help** display this information page and exit.

-  **-version** display version information and exit.
