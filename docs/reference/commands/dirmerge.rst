.. _dirmerge:

dirmerge
===================

Synopsis
--------

Splice / merge multiple sets of directions in such a way as to maintain near-optimality upon truncation

Usage
--------

::

    dirmerge [ options ]  subsets bvalue files [ bvalue files ... ] out

-  *subsets*: the number of subsets (eg. phase encoding directions) per b-value
-  *bvalue files*: the b-value and sets of corresponding files, in order
-  *out*: the output directions file, with each row listing the X Y Z gradient directions, the b-value, and an index representing the phase encode direction

Options
-------

-  **-unipolar_weight value** set the weight given to the unipolar electrostatic repulsion model compared to the bipolar model (default: 0.2).

Standard options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **-info** display information messages.

-  **-quiet** do not display information messages or progress status; alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.

-  **-debug** display debugging messages.

-  **-force** force overwrite of output files (caution: using the same file as input and output might cause unexpected behaviour).

-  **-nthreads number** use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).

-  **-config key value** *(multiple uses permitted)* temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.

-  **-help** display this information page and exit.

-  **-version** display version information and exit.
