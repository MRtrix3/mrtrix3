mrconvert
===================

Synopsis
--------

Perform conversion between different file types and optionally extract a subset of the input image

Usage
--------

::

    mrconvert [ options ]  input output

-  *input*: the input image.
-  *output*: the output image.

Description
-----------

If used correctly, this program can be a very useful workhorse. In addition to converting images between different formats, it can be used to extract specific studies from a data set, extract a specific region of interest, or flip the images. Some of the possible operations are described in more detail below.

Note that for both the -coord and -axes options, indexing starts from 0 rather than 1. E.g. -coord 3 <#> selects volumes (the fourth dimension) from the series; -axes 0,1,2 includes only the three spatial axes in the output image.

Additionally, for the second input to the -coord option and the -axes option, you can use any valid number sequence in the selection, as well as the 'end' keyword (see the main documentation for details); this can be particularly useful to select multiple coordinates.

The -vox option is used to change the size of the voxels in the output image as reported in the image header; note however that this does not re-sample the image based on a new voxel size (that is done using the mrresize command).

By default, the intensity scaling parameters in the input image header are passed through to the output image header when writing to an integer image, and reset to 0,1 (i.e. no scaling) for floating-point and binary images. Note that the -scaling option will therefore have no effect for floating-point or binary output images.

The -axes option specifies which axes from the input image will be used to form the output image. This allows the permutation, omission, or addition of axes into the output image. The axes should be supplied as a comma-separated list of axis indices. If an axis from the input image is to be omitted from the output image, it must either already have a size of 1, or a single coordinate along that axis must be selected by the user by using the -coord option. Examples are provided further below.

Example usages
--------------

-   *Extract the first volume from a 4D image, and make the output a 3D image*::

        $ mrconvert in.mif -coord 3 0 -axes 0,1,2 out.mif

    The -coord 3 0 option extracts, from axis number 3 (which is the fourth axis since counting begins from 0; this is the axis that steps across image volumes), only coordinate number 0 (i.e. the first volume). The -axes 0,1,2 ensures that only the first three axes (i.e. the spatial axes) are retained; if this option were not used in this example, then image out.mif would be a 4D image, but it would only consist of a single volume, and mrinfo would report its size along the fourth axis as 1.

-   *Extract slice number 24 along the AP direction*::

        $ mrconvert volume.mif slice.mif -coord 1 24

    MRtrix3 uses a RAS (Right-Anterior-Superior) axis convention, and internally reorients images upon loading in order to conform to this as far as possible. So for non-exotic data, axis 1 should correspond (approximately) to the anterior-posterior direction.

-   *Extract only every other volume from a 4D image*::

        $ mrconvert all.mif every_other.mif -coord 3 1:2:end

    This example demonstrates two features: Use of the colon syntax to conveniently specify a number sequence (in the format 'start:step:stop'); and use of the 'end' keyword to generate this sequence up to the size of the input image along that axis (i.e. the number of volumes).

-   *Alter the image header to report a new isotropic voxel size*::

        $ mrconvert in.mif isotropic.mif -vox 1.25

    By providing a single value to the -vox option only, the specified value is used to set the voxel size in mm for all three spatial axes in the output image.

-   *Alter the image header to report a new anisotropic voxel size*::

        $ mrconvert in.mif anisotropic.mif -vox 1,,3.5

    This example will change the reported voxel size along the first and third axes (ideally left-right and inferior-superior) to 1.0mm and 3.5mm respectively, and leave the voxel size along the second axis (ideally anterior-posterior) unchanged.

-   *Turn a single-volume 4D image into a 3D image*::

        $ mrconvert 4D.mif 3D.mif -axes 0,1,2

    Sometimes in the process of extracting or calculating a single 3D volume from a 4D image series, the size of the image reported by mrinfo will be "X x Y x Z x 1", indicating that the resulting image is in fact also 4D, it just happens to contain only one volume. This example demonstrates how to convert this into a genuine 3D image (i.e. mrinfo will report the size as "X x Y x Z".

-   *Insert an axis of size 1 into the image*::

        $ mrconvert XYZD.mif XYZ1D.mif -axes 0,1,2,-1,3

    This example uses the value -1 as a flag to indicate to mrconvert where a new axis of unity size is to be inserted. In this particular example, the input image has four axes: the spatial axes X, Y and Z, and some form of data D is stored across the fourth axis (i.e. volumes). Due to insertion of a new axis, the output image is 5D: the three spatial axes (XYZ), a single volume (the size of the output image along the fourth axis will be 1), and data D will be stored as volume groups along the fifth axis of the image.

-   *Manually reset the data scaling parameters stored within the image header to defaults*::

        $ mrconvert with_scaling.mif without_scaling.mif -scaling 0.0,1.0

    This command-line option alters the parameters stored within the image header that provide a linear mapping from raw intensity values stored in the image data to some other scale. Where the raw data stored in a particular voxel is I, the value within that voxel is interpreted as: value = offset + (scale x I).  To adjust this scaling, the relevant parameters must be provided as a comma-separated 2-vector of floating-point values, in the format "offset,scale" (no quotation marks). This particular example sets the offset to zero and the scale to one, which equates to no rescaling of the raw intensity data.

Stride options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **-strides spec** specify the strides of the output data in memory; either as a comma-separated list of (signed) integers, or as a template image from which the strides shall be extracted and used. The actual strides produced will depend on whether the output image format can support it.

This should be supplied as a 4xN text file with each line is in the format [ X Y Z b ], where [ X Y Z ] describe the direction of the applied gradient, and b gives the b-value in units of s/mm^2. If a diffusion gradient scheme is present in the input image header, the data provided with this option will be instead used.
