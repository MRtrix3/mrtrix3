.. _peakscheck:

peakscheck
==========

Synopsis
--------

Check the orientations of an image containing discrete fibre orientations

Usage
-----

::

    peakscheck input [ options ]

-  *input*: The input fibre orientations image to be checked

Description
-----------

MRtrix3 expects "peaks" images to be stored using the real / scanner space axes as reference. There are three possible sources of error in this interpretation: 1. There may be erroneous axis flips and/or permutations, but within the real / scanner space reference. 2. The image data may provide fibre orientations with reference to the image axes rather than real / scanner space. Here there are two additional possibilities: 2a. There may be requisite axis permutations / flips to be applied to the image data *before* transforming them to real / scanner space. 2b. There may be requisite axis permutations / flips to be applied to the image data *after* transforming them to real / scanner space.

Options
-------

- **-mask image** Provide a mask image within which to seed & constrain tracking

- **-number value** Set the number of tracks to generate for each test

- **-threshold value** Modulate thresold on the ratio of empirical to maximal mean length to issue an error

- **-in_format choice** The format in which peak orientations are specified; one of: spherical,unitspherical,3vector,unit3vector

- **-noshuffle** Do not evaluate possibility of requiring shuffles of axes or angles; only consider prospective transforms from alternative reference frames to real / scanner space

- **-notransform** Do not evaluate possibility of requiring transform of peak orientations from image to real / scanner space; only consider prospective shuffles of axes or angles

- **-all** Print table containing all results to standard output

- **-out_table file** Write text file with table containing all results

Additional standard options for Python scripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **-nocleanup** do not delete intermediate files during script execution, and do not delete scratch directory at script completion.

- **-scratch /path/to/scratch/** manually specify an existing directory in which to generate the scratch directory.

- **-continue ScratchDir LastFile** continue the script from a previous execution; must provide the scratch directory path, and the name of the last successfully-generated file.

Standard options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **-info** display information messages.

- **-quiet** do not display information messages or progress status. Alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.

- **-debug** display debugging messages.

- **-force** force overwrite of output files.

- **-nthreads number** use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).

- **-config key value**  *(multiple uses permitted)* temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.

- **-help** display this information page and exit.

- **-version** display version information and exit.
