warpconvert
===================

Synopsis
--------

Convert between different representations of a non-linear warp

Usage
-----

::

    warpconvert operation [ options ] ...

-  *operation*: Select the operation to be used; additional details and options become available once an operation is nominated. Options are: deformation2displacement, displacement2deformation, warpfull2deformation, warpfull2displacement

Description
-----------

A deformation field is defined as an image where each voxel defines the corresponding position in the other image (in scanner space coordinates). A displacement field stores the displacements (in mm) to the other image from each voxel's position (in scanner space). The warpfull file is the 5D format output from mrregister -nl_warp_full, which contains linear transforms, warps and their inverses that map each image to a midway space. The operation to be performed is nominated as the first argument; the subsequent arguments and options available depend on the nominated operation.

Options
-------

Data type options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **-datatype spec** specify output image data type. (choices: float16, float16le, float16be, float32, float32le, float32be, float64, float64le, float64be, int64, uint64, int64le, uint64le, int64be, uint64be, int32, uint32, int32le, uint32le, int32be, uint32be, int16, uint16, int16le, uint16le, int16be, uint16be, cfloat16, cfloat16le, cfloat16be, cfloat32, cfloat32le, cfloat32be, cfloat64, cfloat64le, cfloat64be, int8, uint8, bit)

Standard options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **-force** force overwrite of output files (caution: using the same file as input and output might cause unexpected behaviour).

-  **-nthreads number** use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading). (minimum: 0)

-  **-config key value**  *(multiple uses permitted)* temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.

-  **-help** display this information page and exit.

-  **-version** display version information and exit.

Verbosity options
"""""""""""""""""

-  **-info** display information messages.

-  **-quiet** do not display information messages or progress status; alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.

-  **-debug** display debugging messages & debug input data.

*(these options are mutually exclusive; at most one may be specified)*
