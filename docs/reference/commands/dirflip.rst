.. _dirflip:

dirflip
===================

Synopsis
--------

Invert the polarity of individual directions so as to optimise a unipolar electrostatic repulsion model

Usage
--------

::

    dirflip [ options ]  in out

-  *in*: the input files for the directions.
-  *out*: the output files for the directions.

Description
-----------

The orientations themselves are not affected, only their polarity; this is necessary to ensure near-optimal distribution of DW directions for eddy-current correction.

Options
-------

-  **-permutations num** number of permutations to try (default: 100000000)

-  **-cartesian** Output the directions in Cartesian coordinates [x y z] instead of [az el].

Standard options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **-info** display information messages.

-  **-quiet** do not display information messages or progress status; alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.

-  **-debug** display debugging messages.

-  **-force** force overwrite of output files (caution: using the same file as input and output might cause unexpected behaviour).

-  **-nthreads number** use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).

-  **-config key value** *(multiple uses permitted)* temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.

-  **-help** display this information page and exit.

-  **-version** display version information and exit.
