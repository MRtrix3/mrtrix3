labelconvert
===================

Synopsis
--------

Convert a connectome node image from one lookup table to another

Usage
--------

::

    labelconvert [ options ]  path_in lut_in lut_out image_out

-  *path_in*: the input image
-  *lut_in*: the connectome lookup table for the input image
-  *lut_out*: the target connectome lookup table for the output image
-  *image_out*: the output image

Description
-----------

Typical usage is to convert a parcellation image provided by some other software, based on the lookup table provided by that software, to conform to a new lookup table, particularly one where the node indices increment from 1, in preparation for connectome construction; examples of such target lookup table files are provided in share//mrtrix3//labelconvert//

Options
-------

-  **-spine image** provide a manually-defined segmentation of the base of the spine where the streamlines terminate, so that this can become a node in the connection matrix.

Standard options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **-info** display information messages.

-  **-quiet** do not display information messages or progress status. Alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.

-  **-debug** display debugging messages.

-  **-force** force overwrite of output files. Caution: Using the same file as input and output might cause unexpected behaviour.

-  **-nthreads number** use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).

-  **-help** display this information page and exit.

-  **-version** display version information and exit.
