.. _dirrotate:

dirrotate
===================

Synopsis
--------

Apply a rotation to a direction set

Usage
--------

::

    dirrotate [ options ]  in out

-  *in*: the input direction file
-  *out*: the output direction file

Description
-----------

The primary use case of this command is to find, for a given basis direction set, an appropriate rotation that preserves the homogeneity of coverage on the sphere but that minimises the maximal peak amplitude along the physical axes of the scanner, so as to minimise the peak gradient system demands. It can alternatively be used to introduce a random rotation to hopefully prevent any collinearity between directions in different shells, by requesting only a single rotation.

Options
-------

-  **-number num** number of rotations to try (default: 100000000)

-  **-cartesian** Output the directions in Cartesian coordinates [x y z] instead of [az el].

Standard options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **-info** display information messages.

-  **-quiet** do not display information messages or progress status; alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.

-  **-debug** display debugging messages.

-  **-force** force overwrite of output files (caution: using the same file as input and output might cause unexpected behaviour).

-  **-nthreads number** use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).

-  **-config key value** *(multiple uses permitted)* temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.

-  **-help** display this information page and exit.

-  **-version** display version information and exit.
