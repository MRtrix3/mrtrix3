fixelreorient
===================

Synopsis
--------

Reorient fixel directions

Usage
--------

::

    fixelreorient [ options ]  fixel_in warp fixel_out

-  *fixel_in*: the input fixel directory
-  *warp*: a 4D deformation field used to perform reorientation. Reorientation is performed by applying the Jacobian affine transform in each voxel in the warp, then re-normalising the vector representing the fixel direction
-  *fixel_out*: the output fixel directory. If the the input and output directories are the same, the existing directions file will be replaced (providing the -force option is supplied). If a new directory is supplied then the fixel directions and all other fixel data will be copied to the new directory.

Description
-----------

Reorientation is performed by transforming the vector representing the fixel direction with the Jacobian (local affine transform) computed at each voxel in the warp, then re-normalising the vector.

Options
-------

Standard options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **-info** display information messages.

-  **-quiet** do not display information messages or progress status; alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.

-  **-debug** display debugging messages.

-  **-force** force overwrite of output files (caution: using the same file as input and output might cause unexpected behaviour).

-  **-nthreads number** use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).

-  **-config key value**  *(multiple uses permitted)* temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.

-  **-help** display this information page and exit.

-  **-version** display version information and exit.
