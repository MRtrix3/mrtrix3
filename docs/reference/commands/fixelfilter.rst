fixelfilter
===================

Synopsis
--------

Perform filtering operations on fixel-based data

Usage
--------

::

    fixelfilter [ options ]  input filter output

-  *input*: the input: either a fixel data file, or a fixel directory (see Description)
-  *filter*: the filtering operation to perform; options are: connect, smooth
-  *output*: the output: either a fixel data file, or a fixel directory (see Description)

Description
-----------

If the first input to the command is a specific fixel data file, then a filtered version of only that file will be generated by the command. Alternatively, if the input is the location of a fixel directory, then the command will create a duplicate of the fixel directory, and apply the specified filter operation to all fixel data files within the directory.

For the smoothing filter, it is typically recommended that the provided fixel-fixel connectivity matrix should include both streamline-based connection strength and spatial distance between fixels; this can be generated by the MRtrix3 command fixelconnectivity, specifically using the -smoothing option.

Options
-------

-  **-matrix file** provide a fixel-fixel connectivity matrix for filtering operations that require it

Standard options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **-info** display information messages.

-  **-quiet** do not display information messages or progress status. Alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.

-  **-debug** display debugging messages.

-  **-force** force overwrite of output files. Caution: Using the same file as input and output might cause unexpected behaviour.

-  **-nthreads number** use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).

-  **-help** display this information page and exit.

-  **-version** display version information and exit.
