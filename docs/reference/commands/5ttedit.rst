.. _5ttedit:

5ttedit
===================

Synopsis
--------

Manually set the partial volume fractions in an ACT five-tissue-type (5TT) image

Usage
--------

::

    5ttedit [ options ]  input output

-  *input*: the 5TT image to be modified
-  *output*: the output modified 5TT image

Description
-----------

The user-provided images are interpreted as desired partial volume fractions in the output image. For any voxel with a non-zero value in such an image, this will be the value for that tissue in the output 5TT image. For tissues for which the user has not explicitly requested a change to the partial volume fraction, the partial volume fraction may nevertheless change in order to preserve the requirement of a unity sum of partial volume fractions in each voxel.

Any voxels that are included in the mask provided by the -none option will be erased in the output image; this supersedes all other user inputs.

Options
-------

-  **-cgm image** provide an image of new cortical grey matter partial volume fractions

-  **-sgm image** provide an image of new sub-cortical grey matter partial volume fractions

-  **-wm image** provide an image of new white matter partial volume fractions

-  **-csf image** provide an image of new CSF partial volume fractions

-  **-path image** provide an image of new pathological tissue partial volume fractions

-  **-none image** provide a mask of voxels that should be cleared (i.e. are non-brain)

Standard options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **-info** display information messages.

-  **-quiet** do not display information messages or progress status; alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.

-  **-debug** display debugging messages.

-  **-force** force overwrite of output files (caution: using the same file as input and output might cause unexpected behaviour).

-  **-nthreads number** use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).

-  **-config key value** *(multiple uses permitted)* temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.

-  **-help** display this information page and exit.

-  **-version** display version information and exit.
