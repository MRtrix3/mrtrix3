===========

Synopsis
--------

::

    warpinit [ options ]  template warp

-  *template*: the input template image.
-  *warp*: the output warp image.

Description
-----------

create an initial warp image, representing an identity transformation. 

This is useful to obtain the warp fields from other normalisation applications, by applying the transformation of interest to the warp field generated by this program.

The image generated is a 4D image with the same spatial characteristics as the input template image. It contains 3 volumes, with each voxel containing its own x,y,z coordinates.

Note that this command can be used to create 3 separate X,Y,Z images directly (which may be useful to create images suitable for use in the registration program) using the following syntax:

  $ warpinit template.mif warp-[].nii
