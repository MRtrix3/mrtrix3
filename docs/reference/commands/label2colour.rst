.. _label2colour:

label2colour
===================

Synopsis
--------

Convert a parcellated image (where values are node indices) into a colour image

Usage
--------

::

    label2colour [ options ]  nodes_in colour_out

-  *nodes_in*: the input node parcellation image
-  *colour_out*: the output colour image

Description
-----------

Many software packages handle this colouring internally within their viewer program; this binary explicitly converts a parcellation image into a colour image that should be viewable in any software.

Options
-------

-  **-lut file** Provide the relevant colour lookup table (if not provided, nodes will be coloured randomly)

Standard options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **-info** display information messages.

-  **-quiet** do not display information messages or progress status; alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.

-  **-debug** display debugging messages.

-  **-force** force overwrite of output files (caution: using the same file as input and output might cause unexpected behaviour).

-  **-nthreads number** use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).

-  **-config key value** *(multiple uses permitted)* temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.

-  **-help** display this information page and exit.

-  **-version** display version information and exit.
