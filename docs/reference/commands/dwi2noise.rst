dwi2noise
===================

Synopsis
--------

Estimate noise level voxel-wise using residuals from a truncated SH fit

Usage
--------

::

    dwi2noise [ options ]  dwi noise

-  *dwi*: the input diffusion-weighted image.
-  *noise*: the output noise map

Description
-----------

WARNING: This command is deprecated and may be removed in future releases. Try using the dwidenoise command with the -noise option instead.

Options
-------

-  **-lmax order** set the maximum harmonic order for the output series. By default, the program will use the highest possible lmax given the number of diffusion-weighted images, up to a maximum of 8.

DW gradient table import options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **-grad file** Provide the diffusion-weighted gradient scheme used in the acquisition in a text file. This should be supplied as a 4xN text file with each line is in the format [ X Y Z b ], where [ X Y Z ] describe the direction of the applied gradient, and b gives the b-value in units of s/mm^2. If a diffusion gradient scheme is present in the input image header, the data provided with this option will be instead used.

-  **-fslgrad bvecs bvals** Provide the diffusion-weighted gradient scheme used in the acquisition in FSL bvecs/bvals format files. If a diffusion gradient scheme is present in the input image header, the data provided with this option will be instead used.

-  **-bvalue_scaling mode** specifies whether the b-values should be scaled by the square of the corresponding DW gradient norm, as often required for multi-shell or DSI DW acquisition schemes. The default action can also be set in the MRtrix config file, under the BValueScaling entry. Valid choices are yes/no, true/false, 0/1 (default: true).

DW shell selection options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **-shells list** specify one (or more) diffusion-weighted gradient shells to use during processing, as a comma-separated list of the desired approximate b-values. Note that some commands are incompatible with multiple shells, and will throw an error if more than one b-value is provided.

Standard options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **-info** display information messages.

-  **-quiet** do not display information messages or progress status.

-  **-debug** display debugging messages.

-  **-force** force overwrite of output files. Caution: Using the same file as input and output might cause unexpected behaviour.

-  **-nthreads number** use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading)

-  **-failonwarn** terminate program if a warning is produced

-  **-help** display this information page and exit.

-  **-version** display version information and exit.
