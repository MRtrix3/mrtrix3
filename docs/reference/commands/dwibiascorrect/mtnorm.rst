dwibiascorrect mtnorm
=====================

Synopsis
--------

Perform DWI bias field correction using the "mtnormalise" command

Usage
-----

::

    dwibiascorrect mtnorm input output [ options ]

-  *input*: The input image series to be corrected
-  *output*: The output corrected image series

Description
-----------

This algorithm bases its operation almost entirely on the utilisation of multi-tissue decomposition information to estimate an underlying B1 receive field, as is implemented in the MRtrix3 command "mtnormalise". Its typical usage is however slightly different, in that the primary output of the command is not the bias-field-corrected FODs, but a bias-field-corrected version of the DWI series.

The operation of this script is a subset of that performed by the script "dwibiasnormmask". Many users may find that comprehensive solution preferable; this dwibiascorrect algorithm is nevertheless provided to demonstrate specifically the bias field correction portion of that command.

The ODFs estimated within this optimisation procedure are by default of lower maximal spherical harmonic degree than what would be advised for analysis. This is done for computational efficiency. This behaviour can be modified through the -lmax command-line option.

Options
-------

Options common to all dwibiascorrect algorithms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **-mask image** Manually provide an input mask image for bias field estimation

-  **-bias image** Output an image containing the estimated bias field

Options for importing the diffusion gradient table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **-grad file** Provide the diffusion gradient table in MRtrix format

-  **-fslgrad bvecs bvals** Provide the diffusion gradient table in FSL bvecs/bvals format

*(these options are mutually exclusive; at most one may be specified)*


Options specific to the "mtnorm" algorithm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **-lmax values** The maximum spherical harmonic degree for the estimated FODs (see Description); defaults are "4,0,0" for multi-shell and "4,0" for single-shell data) (values must be non-negative and even)

Standard options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **-force** force overwrite of output files.

-  **-nthreads number** use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading). (minimum: 0)

-  **-config key value**  *(multiple uses permitted)* temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.

-  **-help** display this information page and exit.

-  **-version** display version information and exit.

Verbosity options
"""""""""""""""""

-  **-info** display information messages.

-  **-quiet** do not display information messages or progress status. Alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.

-  **-debug** display debugging messages & debug input data.

*(these options are mutually exclusive; at most one may be specified)*


Additional standard options for Python scripts
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

-  **-nocleanup** do not delete intermediate files during script execution, and do not delete scratch directory at script completion.

-  **-scratch /path/to/scratch/** manually specify an existing directory in which to generate the scratch directory.

-  **-continue ScratchDir LastFile** continue the script from a previous execution; must provide the scratch directory path, and the name of the last successfully-generated file.
