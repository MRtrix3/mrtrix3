5ttgen
======

Synopsis
--------

Generate a 5TT image suitable for ACT

Usage
-----

::

    5ttgen algorithm [ options ] ...

-  *algorithm*: Select the algorithm to be used; additional details and options become available once an algorithm is nominated. Options are: deep_atropos, dhcp, freesurfer, fsl, gif, hsvs, mcrib

Description
-----------

5ttgen acts as a "master" script for generating a five-tissue-type (5TT) segmented tissue image suitable for use in Anatomically-Constrained Tractography (ACT). A range of different algorithms are available for completing this task. When using this script, the name of the algorithm to be used must appear as the first argument on the command-line after "5ttgen". The subsequent compulsory arguments and options available depend on the particular algorithm being invoked.

Each algorithm available also has its own help page, including necessary references; e.g. to see the help page of the "fsl" algorithm, type "5ttgen fsl".

Options

.. _5ttgen_deep_atropos:

5ttgen deep_atropos
===================

Synopsis
--------

Generate the 5TT image based on a Deep Atropos segmentation or probabilities image

Usage
-----

::

    5ttgen deep_atropos input output [ options ]

-  *input*: The input Deep Atropos segmentation image
-  *output*: The output 5TT image

Description
-----------

This algorithm can accept the outputs of Deep Atropos in one of two forms. The "segmentation image" is a 3D image, of integer datatype, with indices mapping to discrete tissue classes as follows: 0: Background; 1: CSF; 2: Gray Matter; 3: White Matter; 4: Deep Gray Matter; 5: Brain Stem; 6: Cerebellum. The "probabilities images" are a set of seven 3D volumes, each corresponding to the posterior probability of one of the seven tissue classes above. These can be provided as input to this command by concatenating into a 4D image series with 7 volumes (the order of which must match that above).

The example usages provided in this help page, which include execution of Deep Atropos itself within a Python environment, require that "ants" and "antspynet" be installed via Python's "pip"; use of the "probability images" also requires that nibabel and numpy be installed.

Example usages
--------------

-   *To utilise the "segmentation" image*::

        $ python3 -c "import ants, antspynet; t1w = ants.image_read('T1w.nii.gz'); result = antspynet.deep_atropos(t1w); ants.image_write(result['segmentation_image'], 'segmentation.nii.gz')"; 5ttgen deep_atropos segmentation.nii.gz 5tt_segmentation.mif

    Because the input segmentation here is an integer image, where each voxel just contains an index corresponding to the maximal tissue class, the output 5TT image will not possess any fractional partial volumes; it will just contain the value 1.0 in whichever 5TT volume corresponds to the singular assigned tissue class.

-   *To utilise the "probability images"*::

        $ python3 -c "import ants, antspynet, nibabel, numpy; inpath = 'T1w.nii.gz'; t1w_ants = ants.image_read(inpath); t1w_nib = nibabel.load(inpath); result = antspynet.deep_atropos(t1w_ants); prob_maps = numpy.stack([numpy.array(img.numpy()) for img in result['probability_images']], axis=-1); nibabel.save(nibabel.Nifti1Image(prob_maps, t1w_nib.affine), 'probabilities.nii.gz')"; 5ttgen deep_atropos probabilities.nii.gz 5tt_probabilities.mif

    In this use case, the posterior probabilities of these tissue classes are interpreted as partial volume fractions and imported into the derivative 5TT image appropriately.

Options
-------

- **-white_stem** Classify the brainstem as white matter

Options common to all 5ttgen algorithms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **-nocrop** Do NOT crop the resulting 5TT image to reduce its size (keep the same dimensions as the input image)

- **-sgm_amyg_hipp** Represent the amygdalae and hippocampi as sub-cortical grey matter in the 5TT image

Additional standard options for Python scripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **-nocleanup** do not delete intermediate files during script execution, and do not delete scratch directory at script completion.

- **-scratch /path/to/scratch/** manually specify an existing directory in which to generate the scratch directory.

- **-continue ScratchDir LastFile** continue the script from a previous execution; must provide the scratch directory path, and the name of the last successfully-generated file.

Standard options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **-info** display information messages.

- **-quiet** do not display information messages or progress status. Alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.

- **-debug** display debugging messages.

- **-force** force overwrite of output files.

- **-nthreads number** use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).

- **-config key value**  *(multiple uses permitted)* temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.

- **-help** display this information page and exit.

- **-version** display version information and exit.

.. _5ttgen_dhcp:

5ttgen dhcp
===========

Synopsis
--------

Use ANTs commands, the output of the dHCP pipeline, and the M-CRIB atlas, to generate the 5TT image of a neonatal subject based on a T2-weighted image

Usage
-----

::

    5ttgen dhcp input output [ options ]

-  *input*: The input path of the derivates folder (anat/) obtained from the dHCP pipeline
-  *output*: The output 5TT image

Description
-----------

Derivation of the 5TT image is principally based on the segmentation already performed in the dHCP pipeline. The M-CRIB atlas will only be used to introduce additional sub-cortical grey matter parcels into the tissue segmentation. By default, the algorithm will use the tissue probability maps obtained from the dHCP. However, if the pipeline was executed without the -additional command-line flag, the algorithm will use the hard segmentation.

Options
-------

Options specific to the 'dhcp' algorithm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **-mcrib_path directory** Provide the path of the M-CRIB atlas (note: this can alternatively be specified in the MRtrix config file as "MCRIBPath")

- **-parcellation image** Additionally export the M-CRIB parcellation warped to the subject data

- **-quick** Specify the use of quick registration parameters

- **-hard_segmentation** Specify the use of hard segmentation instead of the soft segmentation to generate the 5TT

- **-ants_parallel value** Control for parallel computation for antsJointLabelFusion (default 0): 0 == run serially; 1 == SGE qsub; 2 == use PEXEC (localhost); 3 == Apple XGrid; 4 == PBS qsub; 5 == SLURM.

Options common to all 5ttgen algorithms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **-nocrop** Do NOT crop the resulting 5TT image to reduce its size (keep the same dimensions as the input image)

.. _5ttgen_mcrib:

5ttgen mcrib
============

Synopsis
--------

Use ANTs commands and the M-CRIB atlas to generate the 5TT image of a neonatal subject based on a T1-weighted or T2-weighted image

Usage
-----

::

    5ttgen mcrib input modality output [ options ]

-  *input*: The input structural image
-  *modality*: Specify the modality of the input image, either "t1w" or "t2w"
-  *output*: The output 5TT image

Description
-----------

The M-CRIB atlas is required for this command, as its segmentations are used to project tissue segmentation information to the input image. These data can be downloaded from: https://osf.io/2yx8u/. The command can be informed of the location of these data in one of two ways: either explicit use of the -mcrib_path option, or through setting the value of MCRIBPath in an MRtrix config file.

It is a necessary component in the production of a 5TT image that a brain mask be determined in some manner. In this algorithm, there are multiple possible mechanisms by which such a mask may arise. Use of the -mask option allows the user to provide as input a pre-calculated mask. Use of the -premasked option indicates that the input image has already been zero-filled outside of the brain. In the absence of either of these options, the command will perform an internal brain mask computation. If the -mask_hdbet option is specified, then the HD-BET method will be used for this purpose; otherwise, the ANTs brain extraction script will be used.

Options
-------

Options that affect the output of the 'mcrib' algorithm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **-white_stem** Classify the brainstem as white matter; streamlines will not be permitted to terminate within this region

- **-parcellation image** Additionally export the M-CRIB parcellation warped to the subject data

- **-hard_segmentation** Specify the use of hard segmentation instead of the soft segmentation to generate the 5TT (not recommended)

Options that affect the internal execution of ANTs within the 'mcrib' algorithm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **-ants_quick** Specify the use of "quick" registration parameters in ANTs: results are a little bit less accurate, but much faster

- **-ants_parallel value** Control for parallel computation for antsJointLabelFusion (default 0): 0 == run serially; 1 == SGE qsub; 2 == use PEXEC (localhost); 3 == Apple XGrid; 4 == PBS qsub; 5 == SLURM.

Options relating to masking for the 'mcrib' algorithm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **-mask image** Manually provide a brain mask, rather than having the script generate one automatically

- **-premasked** Indicate that brain masking has already been applied to the input image

- **-mask_hdbet** Use HD-BET to compute the required brain mask from the input image

Option for providing template data to the 'mcrib' algorithm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **-mcrib_path directory** Provide the path of the M-CRIB atlas

Options common to all 5ttgen algorithms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **-nocrop** Do NOT crop the resulting 5TT image to reduce its size (keep the same dimensions as the input image)

- **-sgm_amyg_hipp** Represent the amygdalae and hippocampi as sub-cortical grey matter in the 5TT image

Additional standard options for Python scripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **-nocleanup** do not delete intermediate files during script execution, and do not delete scratch directory at script completion.

- **-scratch /path/to/scratch/** manually specify an existing directory in which to generate the scratch directory.

- **-continue ScratchDir LastFile** continue the script from a previous execution; must provide the scratch directory path, and the name of the last successfully-generated file.

Standard options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **-info** display information messages.

- **-quiet** do not display information messages or progress status. Alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.

- **-debug** display debugging messages.

- **-force** force overwrite of output files.

- **-nthreads number** use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).

- **-config key value**  *(multiple uses permitted)* temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.

- **-help** display this information page and exit.

- **-version** display version information and exit.
