mrcat
===================

Synopsis
--------

Concatenate several images into one

Usage
--------

::

    mrcat [ options ]  image1 image2 [ image2 ... ] output

-  *image1*: the first input image.
-  *image2*: additional input image(s).
-  *output*: the output image.

Example usages
--------------

-   *Concatenate individual 3D volumes into a single 4D image series*::

        $ mrcat volume*.mif series.mif

    The wildcard characters will find all images in the current working directory with names that begin with "volume" and end with ".mif"; the mrcat command will receive these as a list of input file names, from which it will produce a 4D image where the input volumes have been concatenated along axis 3 (the fourth axis; the spatial axes are 0, 1 & 2).

Options
-------

-  **-axis axis** specify axis along which concatenation should be performed. By default, the program will use the last non-singleton, non-spatial axis of any of the input images - in other words axis 3 or whichever axis (greater than 3) of the input images has size greater than one.

Data type options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **-datatype spec** specify output image data type. Valid choices are: float32, float32le, float32be, float64, float64le, float64be, int64, uint64, int64le, uint64le, int64be, uint64be, int32, uint32, int32le, uint32le, int32be, uint32be, int16, uint16, int16le, uint16le, int16be, uint16be, cfloat32, cfloat32le, cfloat32be, cfloat64, cfloat64le, cfloat64be, int8, uint8, bit.

Standard options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **-info** display information messages.

-  **-quiet** do not display information messages or progress status; alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.

-  **-debug** display debugging messages.

-  **-force** force overwrite of output files (caution: using the same file as input and output might cause unexpected behaviour).

-  **-nthreads number** use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).

-  **-help** display this information page and exit.

-  **-version** display version information and exit.
