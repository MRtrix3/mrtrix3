sh2amp
===================

Synopsis
--------

Evaluate the amplitude of an image of spherical harmonic functions along specified directions

Usage
--------

::

    sh2amp [ options ]  input directions output

-  *input*: the input image consisting of spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients.
-  *directions*: the list of directions along which the SH functions will be sampled, generated using the dirgen command
-  *output*: the output image consisting of the amplitude of the SH functions along the specified directions.

Options
-------

-  **-gradient** assume input directions are supplied as a gradient encoding file

-  **-nonnegative** cap all negative amplitudes to zero

Stride options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **-stride spec** specify the strides of the output data in memory, as a comma-separated list. The actual strides produced will depend on whether the output image format can support it.

Data type options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **-datatype spec** specify output image data type. Valid choices are: float32, float32le, float32be, float64, float64le, float64be, int64, uint64, int64le, uint64le, int64be, uint64be, int32, uint32, int32le, uint32le, int32be, uint32be, int16, uint16, int16le, uint16le, int16be, uint16be, cfloat32, cfloat32le, cfloat32be, cfloat64, cfloat64le, cfloat64be, int8, uint8, bit.

Standard options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **-info** display information messages.

-  **-quiet** do not display information messages or progress status.

-  **-debug** display debugging messages.

-  **-force** force overwrite of output files. Caution: Using the same file as input and output might cause unexpected behaviour.

-  **-nthreads number** use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading)

-  **-failonwarn** terminate program if a warning is produced

-  **-help** display this information page and exit.

-  **-version** display version information and exit.
