mrcalc
===================

Synopsis
--------

Apply generic voxel-wise mathematical operations to images

Usage
--------

::

    mrcalc [ options ]  operand [ operand ... ]

-  *operand*: an input image, intensity value, or the special keywords 'rand' (random number between 0 and 1) or 'randn' (random number from unit std.dev. normal distribution) or the mathematical constants 'e' and 'pi'.

Description
-----------

This command will only compute per-voxel operations. Use 'mrmath' to compute summary statistics across images or along image axes.

This command uses a stack-based syntax, with operators (specified using options) operating on the top-most entries (i.e. images or values) in the stack. Operands (values or images) are pushed onto the stack in the order they appear (as arguments) on the command-line, and operators (specified as options) operate on and consume the top-most entries in the stack, and push their output as a new entry on the stack.

As an additional feature, this command will allow images with different dimensions to be processed, provided they satisfy the following conditions: for each axis, the dimensions match if they are the same size, or one of them has size one. In the latter case, the entire image will be replicated along that axis. This allows for example a 4D image of size [ X Y Z N ] to be added to a 3D image of size [ X Y Z ], as if it consisted of N copies of the 3D image along the 4th axis (the missing dimension is assumed to have size 1). Another example would a single-voxel 4D image of size [ 1 1 1 N ], multiplied by a 3D image of size [ X Y Z ], which would allow the creation of a 4D image where each volume consists of the 3D image scaled by the corresponding value for that volume in the single-voxel image.

Example usages
--------------

-   *Double the value stored in every voxel*::

        $ mrcalc a.mif 2 -mult r.mif

    This performs the operation: r = 2*a  for every voxel a,r in images a.mif and r.mif respectively.

-   *A more complex example*::

        $ mrcalc a.mif -neg b.mif -div -exp 9.3 -mult r.mif

    This performs the operation: r = 9.3*exp(-a/b)

-   *Another complex example*::

        $ mrcalc a.mif b.mif -add c.mif d.mif -mult 4.2 -add -div r.mif

    This performs: r = (a+b)/(c*d+4.2).

-   *Rescale the densities in a SH l=0 image*::

        $ mrcalc ODF_CSF.mif 4 pi -mult -sqrt -div ODF_CSF_scaled.mif

    This applies the spherical harmonic basis scaling factor: 1.0/sqrt(4*pi), such that a single-tissue voxel containing the same intensities as the response function of that tissue should contain the value 1.0.
