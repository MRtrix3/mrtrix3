fixelcfestats
===================

Synopsis
--------

Fixel-based analysis using connectivity-based fixel enhancement and non-parametric permutation testing

Usage
--------

::

    fixelcfestats [ options ]  in_fixel_directory subjects design contrast tracks out_fixel_directory

-  *in_fixel_directory*: the fixel directory containing the data files for each subject (after obtaining fixel correspondence
-  *subjects*: a text file listing the subject identifiers (one per line). This should correspond with the filenames in the fixel directory (including the file extension), and be listed in the same order as the rows of the design matrix.
-  *design*: the design matrix
-  *contrast*: the contrast matrix, specified as rows of weights
-  *tracks*: the tracks used to determine fixel-fixel connectivity
-  *out_fixel_directory*: the output directory where results will be saved. Will be created if it does not exist

Description
-----------

Fixel connectivity information for this command can be initialised in one of two ways, depending on what data are provided as the fifth input to the command. If a track file is provided here (as is the original functionality of the fixelcfestats command), then the command will use this track file to construct two fixel-fixel connectivity matrices: One for the purpose of smoothing the input data (which it will automatically perform prior to permutation testing), and one for the Connectivity-based Fixel Enhancement (CFE) algorithm. If a text file is instead provided, this will be interpreted as a pre-computed fixel-fixel connectivity matrix (e.g. as generated by the MRtrix3 command fixelconnectivity), and used directly; furthermore, it will be assumed that the data provided as input to the command have already had any desired smoothing applied (e.g. using the MRtrix3 command fixelfilter).

In some software packages, a column of ones is automatically added to the GLM design matrix; the purpose of this column is to estimate the "global intercept", which is the predicted value of the observed variable if all explanatory variables were to be zero. However there are rare situations where including such a column would not be appropriate for a particular experimental design. Hence, in MRtrix3 statistical inference commands, it is up to the user to determine whether or not this column of ones should be included in their design matrix, and add it explicitly if necessary. The contrast matrix must also reflect the presence of this additional column.

Note that if the -mask option is used, the output fixel directory will still contain the same set of fixels as that present in the input fixel template, in order to retain fixel correspondence. However a consequence of this is that all fixels in the template will be initialy visible when the output fixel directory is loaded in mrview. Those fixels outside the processing mask will immediately disappear from view as soon as any data-file-based fixel colouring or thresholding is applied.

Options
-------

-  **-mask file** provide a fixel data file containing a mask of those fixels to be used during processing

Options relating to shuffling of data for nonparametric statistical inference
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **-errors spec** specify nature of errors for shuffling; options are: ee,ise,both (default: ee)

-  **-nshuffles number** the number of shuffles (default: 5000)

-  **-permutations file** manually define the permutations (relabelling). The input should be a text file defining a m x n matrix, where each relabelling is defined as a column vector of size m, and the number of columns, n, defines the number of permutations. Can be generated with the palm_quickperms function in PALM (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/PALM). Overrides the -nshuffles option.

-  **-signflips file** manually define the signflips

-  **-nonstationarity** perform non-stationarity correction

-  **-skew_nonstationarity value** specify the skew parameter for empirical statistic calculation (default for this command is 1)

-  **-nshuffles_nonstationarity number** the number of shuffles to use when precomputing the empirical statistic image for non-stationarity correction (default: 5000)

-  **-permutations_nonstationarity file** manually define the permutations (relabelling) for computing the emprical statistics for non-stationarity correction. The input should be a text file defining a m x n matrix, where each relabelling is defined as a column vector of size m, and the number of columns, n, defines the number of permutations. Can be generated with the palm_quickperms function in PALM (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/PALM) Overrides the -nshuffles_nonstationarity option.

-  **-signflips_nonstationarity file** manually define the signflips for computing the empirical statistics for non-stationarity correction

Parameters for the Connectivity-based Fixel Enhancement algorithm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **-cfe_dh value** the height increment used in the cfe integration (default: 0.1)

-  **-cfe_e value** cfe extent exponent (default: 2)

-  **-cfe_h value** cfe height exponent (default: 3)

-  **-cfe_c value** cfe connectivity exponent (default: 0.5)

-  **-cfe_norm** use a normalised form of the cfe equation

Options related to the General Linear Model (GLM)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **-ftests path** perform F-tests; input text file should contain, for each F-test, a row containing ones and zeros, where ones indicate the rows of the contrast matrix to be included in the F-test.

-  **-fonly** only assess F-tests; do not perform statistical inference on entries in the contrast matrix

-  **-column path** add a column to the design matrix corresponding to subject fixel-wise values (note that the contrast matrix must include an additional column for each use of this option); the text file provided via this option should contain a file name for each subject

Options for fixel-fixel connectivity matrix generation & usage from an input track file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **-smooth FWHM** smooth the fixel value along the fibre tracts using a Gaussian kernel with the supplied FWHM (default: 10mm)

-  **-connectivity threshold** a threshold to define the required fraction of shared connections to be included in the neighbourhood (default: 0.01)

-  **-angle value** the max angle threshold for assigning streamline tangents to fixels (Default: 45 degrees)

Standard options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **-info** display information messages.

-  **-quiet** do not display information messages or progress status. Alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.

-  **-debug** display debugging messages.

-  **-force** force overwrite of output files. Caution: Using the same file as input and output might cause unexpected behaviour.

-  **-nthreads number** use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).

-  **-help** display this information page and exit.

-  **-version** display version information and exit.
