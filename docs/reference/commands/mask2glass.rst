==========

Synopsis
--------

Create a glass brain from mask input

Usage
-----

::

    mask2glass input output [ options ]

-  *input*: The input mask image
-  *output*: The output glass brain image

Description
-----------

The output of this command is a glass brain image, which can be viewed using the volume render option in mrview, and used for visualisation purposes to view results in 3D.

While the name of this script indicates that a binary mask image is required as input, it can also operate on a floating-point image. One way in which this can be exploited is to compute the mean of all subject masks within template space, in which case this script will produce a smoother result than if a binary template mask were to be used as input.

Options
-------

- **-dilate** Provide number of passes for dilation step; default = 2

- **-scale** Provide resolution upscaling value; default = 2.0

- **-smooth** Provide standard deviation of smoothing (in mm); default = 1.0

Additional standard options for Python scripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **-nocleanup** do not delete intermediate files during script execution, and do not delete scratch directory at script completion.

- **-scratch /path/to/scratch/** manually specify the path in which to generate the scratch directory.

- **-continue <ScratchDir> <LastFile>** continue the script from a previous execution; must provide the scratch directory path, and the name of the last successfully-generated file.

Standard options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **-info** display information messages.

- **-quiet** do not display information messages or progress status. Alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.

- **-debug** display debugging messages.

- **-force** force overwrite of output files.

- **-nthreads number** use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).

- **-config key value**  *(multiple uses permitted)* temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.

- **-help** display this information page and exit.

- **-version** display version information and exit.
