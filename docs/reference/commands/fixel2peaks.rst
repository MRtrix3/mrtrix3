.. _fixel2peaks:

fixel2peaks
===================

Synopsis
--------

Convert data in the fixel directory format into a 4D image of 3-vectors

Usage
--------

::

    fixel2peaks [ options ]  in out

-  *in*: the input fixel information
-  *out*: the output peaks image

Description
-----------

If a fixel data file is provided as input, then the 3-vectors in the output image will be scaled based on the data in that file. If the input is instead the fixel directory, or the index or directions file, then all output 3-vectors will possess unit norm.

Options
-------

-  **-number value** maximum number of fixels in each voxel (default: based on input data)

-  **-nan** fill excess peak data with NaNs rather than zeroes

Standard options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **-info** display information messages.

-  **-quiet** do not display information messages or progress status; alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.

-  **-debug** display debugging messages.

-  **-force** force overwrite of output files (caution: using the same file as input and output might cause unexpected behaviour).

-  **-nthreads number** use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).

-  **-config key value** *(multiple uses permitted)* temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.

-  **-help** display this information page and exit.

-  **-version** display version information and exit.
