dirgen
===================

Synopsis
--------

Generate a set of uniformly distributed directions using a bipolar electrostatic repulsion model

Usage
--------

::

    dirgen [ options ]  ndir dirs

-  *ndir*: the number of directions to generate.
-  *dirs*: the text file to write the directions to, as [ az el ] pairs.

Description
-----------

Directions are distributed by analogy to an electrostatic repulsion system, with each direction corresponding to a single electrostatic charge (for -unipolar), or a pair of diametrically opposed charges (for the default bipolar case). The energy of the system is determined based on the Coulomb repulsion, which assumes the form 1/r^power, where r is the distance between any pair of charges, and p is the power assumed for the repulsion law (default: 1). The minimum energy state is obtained by gradient descent.

Options
-------

-  **-power exp** specify exponent to use for repulsion power law (default: 1). This must be a power of 2 (i.e. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...).

-  **-niter num** specify the maximum number of iterations to perform (default: 10000).

-  **-restarts num** specify the number of restarts to perform (default: 10).

-  **-unipolar** optimise assuming a unipolar electrostatic repulsion model rather than the bipolar model normally assumed in DWI

-  **-cartesian** Output the directions in Cartesian coordinates [x y z] instead of [az el].

Standard options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **-info** display information messages.

-  **-quiet** do not display information messages or progress status. Alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a non-empty string.

-  **-debug** display debugging messages.

-  **-force** force overwrite of output files. Caution: Using the same file as input and output might cause unexpected behaviour.

-  **-nthreads number** use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).

-  **-help** display this information page and exit.

-  **-version** display version information and exit.
